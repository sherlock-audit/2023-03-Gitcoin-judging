# `protocolTreasury` and `protocolFeePercentage` in `AlloSettings.sol` are not set during initialization

## Summary

The `initialize` function in `AlloSettings` does not set the contract state variables. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The `AlloSettings` contract has two dynamic state variables, `protocolTreasury` and `protocolFeePercentage`. The `initialize` function in `AlloSettings` does not set the contract state variables, and there are no checks in the `RoundImplementation` to ensure that these values are initialized.

## Impact

A round created when the `protocolTreasury` and `protocolFeePercentage` variables are uninitialized can run normally up to and including the call to `setReadyForPayout`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider adding `protocolTreasury` and `protocolFeePercentage` parameters to the `initialize` function for the `AlloSettings` contract, and setting the state variables appropriately.
