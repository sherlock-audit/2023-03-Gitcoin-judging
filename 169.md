# Programs can use matchAmount = 0 to avoid fees

## Summary

The fees paid out to the protocol are calculated in `setReadyForPayout()` as `protocolFeeAmount = (matchAmount * alloSettings.protocolFeePercentage()) / denominator`. If the program responsible for the round uses `matchAmount = 0`, they will not pay out any fees.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function `setReadyForPayout` will call `payoutStrategy.setReadyForPayout()`:

This is responsible for transferring the funds to the payout contract. However the program intending to distribute the funds can transfer them independently of this call and still have them available to the payout contract.

The payout strategy does not rely on the value of `matchAmount` within the round for its distribution whatsoever.

## Impact

Program using rounds to distribute grants can avoid protocol fees. I label this as a medium because I am unaware how using `matchAmount = 0` will affect the UI, it could be that programs are reluctant to do so.

## Recommendation

Get fees on payout distribution rather than when transferring them from round to payout contract
