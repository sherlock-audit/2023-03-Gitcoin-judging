# roundFeeAddress can launch re-entrancy attack

## Summary

In `setReadyForPayout()` function in https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Gitcoin/blob/main/contracts/contracts/round/RoundImplementation.sol#L443 the `roundFeeAddress` is paid via `safeTransfer` before sending funds to the payout strategy. This allows `roundFeeAddress` to launch a re-entrancy and drain funds. 

## Vulnerability Detail

See 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Gitcoin/blob/main/contracts/contracts/round/RoundImplementation.sol#L461-L474 
`roundFeeAddress` is paid via `_transferAmount` (which in turn uses `safeTransfer` -- see https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Gitcoin/blob/main/contracts/contracts/round/RoundImplementation.sol#L506) before sending funds to the payout strategy. 

## Impact

Funds can be drained by roundFeeAddress with no grants going to the payout strategy.
