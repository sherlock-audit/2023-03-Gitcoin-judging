# Some amount of token used payout may be mistakenly burnt

## Summary
No checks are present while updating `roundFeePercentage` or during initialization of the round implementation contract for `roundFeePercentage` and `roundFeeAddress` values, which causes some amount of tokens to be mistakenly burnt when calling `setReadyForPayout().`

## Vulnerability Detail
No checks are done while updating `roundFeePercentage` or during initialization of the round implementation contract for `roundFeePercentage` and `roundFeeAddress` values, which allows the possibility of a non-zero value of `roundFeePercentage` whereas `roundFeeAddress` can be a zero address. These values cannot be updated once the round has ended.

When `setReadyForPayout()` is called, it means that the round has ended, and the `roundFeePercentage` and `roundFeeAddress` values cannot be updated anymore.

## Impact
if the possibility mentioned above is still in place, it means some amount of the token that is going to be used for payout is going to be mistakenly burnt

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Only allow the initialization/updation of a non-zero `roundFeePercentage` value if `roundFeeAddress` is not a zero address.
