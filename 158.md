# Voting functionality is bricked without manual approvals

## Summary
The vote function in QuadraticFundingVotingStrategyImplementation.sol will not work because of lack of token approvals when ERC20 tokens are used to vote for a project. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The vote function in RoundImplementation.sol calls VotingStrategy.vote() which is meant to pull the to-be-donated tokens from the voter. In case it is an ERC20 token it directly transfers them from the voter to the grant address. However, any token's safetransferfrom function requires that spending allowance be already given to the msg.sender before he can move tokens. 

Most of the popular ERC20 tokens follow a pattern of reverting in case of lack of allowance. In vote() function, since approval is not being given to VotingStrategy contract to move msg.sender's tokens it will always revert. 

## Impact
The voting functionality is bricked for all the ERC20 tokens and the grants program cannot work without that. User will need to manually set approvals, while it should be included in logic.

## Recommendation
Add a IERC20(token).approve statement before the safetransferfrom line
