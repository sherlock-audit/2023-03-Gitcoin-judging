# RoundImplementation.initialize will never execute successfully because the votingStrategy or payoutStrategy in encodedParameters has already been initialized

## Summary

Calling `RoundFactory.create` can create a new Round. This function clones roundImplementation internally, and calls `IRoundImplementation(payable(clone)).initialize(encodedParameters, alloSettings)` to initialize the new Round. There are two very important contract addresses in the encodedParameters parameter: **votingStrategy** and **payoutStrategy**. These two contracts were created before `RoundFactory.create`. **Normally, their init() function are called inside `IRoundImplementation.initialize`**. However, malicious user can **monitor the creation events of votingStrategy and payoutStrategy**, then calls their init() function before `RoundFactory.create`. Of course, he can also **frontrun `RoundFactory.create`** to achieve this goal.

## Vulnerability Detail

When a new PayoutStrategy or VotingStrategy is created, **the first sender** calling init() will be set to **roundAddress**. Let's take a look at their init() code:

```solidity
abstract contract IVotingStrategy {
  /**
   * @notice Invoked by RoundImplementation on creation to
   * set the round for which the voting contracts is to be used
   *
   */
  function init() external {
    require(roundAddress == address(0), "init: roundAddress already set");
    roundAddress = msg.sender;
  }

}

abstract contract IPayoutStrategy {
  /**
   * @notice Invoked by RoundImplementation on creation to
   * set the round for which the payout strategy is to be used
   *
   */
  function init() external {
    require(roundAddress == address(0x0), "roundAddress already set");
    roundAddress = payable(msg.sender);

    // set the token address
    tokenAddress = RoundImplementation(roundAddress).token();

    isReadyForPayout = false;
  }
}
```

As mentioned in Summary, when creating a new Round, as long as one of the votingStrategy and payoutStrategy provided by encodedParameters is initialized, the transaction will revert. **So new round are never created successfully**.

## Impact

The core function of the protocol is to create Round to raise funds for various projects. This issue prevented the creation of Round and destroyed the entire protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

There are two ways to fix it:

1.  Add permissions to the init() function, and grant permissions to the factory before calling `RoundFactory.create`.
2.  By passing the respective factory address, create votingStrategy and payoutStrategy inside `IRoundImplementation.initialize` and initialize them.
