# Revert will send wrong information about Rounds

## Summary
Reverts will send wrong information about Rounds
## Vulnerability Detail
As you can see the method ``` roundHasNotEnded() ``` checks if the round has ended or not. It returns a wrong information "Round has ended", but this is wrong so we must change it to "Round: Round has not ended"



```solidity
 modifier roundHasNotEnded() {
    // slither-disable-next-line timestamp
    require(block.timestamp <= roundEndTime, "Round: Round has ended");
     _;
  }
```
The same problems as the previous method . We must change the output information to ""Round: Round has ended"



```solidity
  modifier roundHasEnded() {
    // slither-disable-next-line timestamp
    require(block.timestamp > roundEndTime, "Round: Round has not ended");
    _;
  }
```

## Impact
This will send wrong information to the places where these methods are used.
