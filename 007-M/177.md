# Discrepancy in round end criteria between payout and round

## Summary

There is a discrepancy in criteria for considering a round as ended between IPayoutStrategy and RoundImplementation resulting in situations where round is considered as ended in one and not the other

## Vulnerability Detail

IPayoutStrategy defines rounded ended as `block.timestamp >= roundEndTime` while RoundImplementation uses `block.timestamp > roundEndTime` meaning that when `block.timestamp == roundEndTime` the round is considered ongoing for `RoundImplementation` and ended for `IPayoutStrategy`.

## Impact

Functions of payout strategies relying on the round being over can be called while the round is still ongoing. In the current implementation of `MerklePayoutStrategyImplementation` this means `updateDistribution()` can be called by round operator while votes are still accepted. Additional votes may come later in the block to the `RoundImplementation` contract which should have impacted the distribution.

If new more automated payout strategies (e.g. 1 token spent = 1 vote) are implemented by programs, this could have higher impact resulting for example in vote tokens being locked.
