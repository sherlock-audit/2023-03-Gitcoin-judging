# Operator can update a round not according to the docs, so users can select or vote at the time they are not supposed to

## Summary
According to the [docs](https://docs.allo.gitcoin.co/core-concepts/round#rounds-in-depth), these are timestamps

But in the code, they are not validating properly
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
    require(newApplicationsStartTime < newApplicationsEndTime, "Round: Application end is before application start");
    require(newRoundStartTime < newRoundEndTime, "Round: Round end is before round start");
    require(newApplicationsStartTime <= newRoundStartTime, "Round: Round start is before application start");
    require(newApplicationsEndTime <= newRoundEndTime, "Round: Round end is before application end");
    require(block.timestamp <= newApplicationsStartTime, "Round: Time has already passed");
```

[/contracts/round/RoundImplementation.sol#L223](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Gitcoin/blob/main/contracts/contracts/round/RoundImplementation.sol#L223)
E.x. `newRoundStartTime` can start before `newApplicationsEndTime`, `newRoundEndTime` can be equal to `newApplicationsEndTime`.
## Impact
A round can be created not according to the docs, so users can select or vote at the time they are not supposed to.
## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
I think it will be better to refactor and use the structure from the docs:
```solidity
    require(block.timestamp <= newApplicationsStartTime, "Round: Time has already passed");
    require(newApplicationsStartTime <= newApplicationsEndTime, "Round: Time has already passed");
    require(newApplicationsEndTime < newRoundStartTime, "Round: Time has already passed");
    require(newRoundStartTime < newRoundEndTime, "Round: Time has already passed");

```
