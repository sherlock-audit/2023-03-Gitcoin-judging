# Round operator could update distribution before round ended.

## Summary
Round operator could update distribution before round ended, due to inconsistent roundHasEnded modifier.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the roundHasEnded modifier of RoundImplementation, the condition for checking whether the round has ended is that block.timestamp is greater than roundEndTime. However, in the roundHasEnded modifier of IPayoutStrategy, the condition for checking whether the round has ended is that block.timestamp is greater than or equal to roundEndTime.
If the round operator calls updateDistribution when block.timestamp is equal to roundEndTime, the check in roundHasEnded will pass, and this will cause an early update of the distribution, which violates the original design.

## Impact
Round operator could update distribution before round has ended.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Revise the condition in roundHasEnded modifier of IPayoutStrategy to:
```diff
  modifier roundHasEnded() {
    uint roundEndTime = RoundImplementation(roundAddress).roundEndTime();
-    require(block.timestamp >= roundEndTime,"round has not ended");
+    require(block.timestamp > roundEndTime,"round has not ended");
    _;
  }

```
