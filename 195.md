# QuadraticFundingVoting vote don't enforce parameters

## Summary

From my understanding of the Documentation and and answers in Sherlock discord, the quadraticFundingVoting contract is just here to emit logs on donation made to each project so then an offchain merkle tree of the vote can be generated and used in the payout strategy to pay the matching tokens to projects.

The vote function has encodedVotes as parameters that can be arbitrary _token, _amount, _grantAddress and _projectId.

## Vulnerability Detail

While passing a wrong _projectId will probably not work thanks to the registry, One could put a valid project but put its own address as _grantAddress to vote for a free (minus gas cost).

Token is also not enforced so one could give a different token than the round token.

## Impact

- If offchain data is not fully checked to be complient with project grant address and round token, a user can vote for free and wrongly influance the matching amount for a project.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Enforce _token and _grantAddress parameters to be valid in the vote function.
