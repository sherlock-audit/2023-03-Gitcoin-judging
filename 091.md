# [medium] Rounds can avoid payment of Allo system fee

## Summary
Rounds can avoid payment of Allo system fee.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the RoundImplementation contract, the protocol fee is calculated based on the matchAmount, not the actual payout amount (which is just whatever is in the contract). So to avoid paying protocol fee, the round can just have a 0 matchAmount so no fee will be paid.

## Impact
Medium

## Recommendation
Base fee calculation on the actual amount of the round instead of the matchAmount.
