# MerklePayoutStrategyImplementation.updateDistribution is called after RoundImplementation.setReadyForPayout, then the funds will not be distributed

## Summary

When the round ends, RoundOperator first calls `MerklePayoutStrategyImplementation.updateDistribution` to update merkleRoot, and then calls `RoundImplementation.setReadyForPayout` to send funds to the MerklePayoutStrategyImplementation contract. The condition for calling `MerklePayoutStrategyImplementation.updateDistribution` is `isReadyForPayout == false`, and `RoundImplementation.setReadyForPayout` will eventually set isReadyForPayout to true. Obviously, if `RoundImplementation.setReadyForPayout` is called first, then there is **no way to update the correct merkleRoot**. In this way, **funds cannot be distributed** to various projects.

## Vulnerability Detail

We assume the two scenarios:

- Bob is one of RoundOperator. When the round ends, he calls `RoundImplementation.setReadyForPayout`. So `isReadyForPayout` equals to true. But `merkleRoot` is not updated, it is 0. Damn, he forgot to call `MerklePayoutStrategyImplementation.updateDistribution` first.
- Bob and Alice are both RoundOperators. When the round ends, Bob thinks that Alice has called `MerklePayoutStrategyImplementation.updateDistribution`, so he calls `RoundImplementation.setReadyForPayout`.

We're not treating Bob as a malicious RoundOperator, he's just being careless.

The contract does not provide a method to reset isReadyForPayout to false. if this happens, we can only create a new round.

## Impact

Funds cannot be distributed to various projects, only new rounds can be created again.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We can check whether merkleRoot is 0 as a condition for calling setReadyForLayout.
