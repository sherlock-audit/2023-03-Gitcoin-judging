# Lack of input Validation in `_distribute()` function

## Summary

The `_distribute()` function in MerklePayoutStrategyImplementation.sol contract lacks proper input validation, which could lead to unexpected behavior or security issues

## Vulnerability Detail

This `_distribute()` function assume that the inputs provided in the `_distribution`  structure are valid and have been properly sanitized before being passed into the function .
But there is no check that `_distribution.amount` is an amount of tokens that is effectively owned on the smart contract and is passed as an argument on the `_transferAmount()` function without check to send them the corresponding value

## Impact

As the _distribute() function is called within a loop on the main function of this contract : `payout()` this kind of lack of input validation could lead to a DOS for the contract as if there is no funds for a single user to be distributed, all the loop will be reverted. 

Moreover as we cannot modify the `Distribution[]` struct of the `payout()` function because : 
1.  it has to be generated with a merkleProof on the MerklePayoutStrategyImplementation.sol#_distribute() function : 
```solidity
require(MerkleProof.verify(_merkleProof,merkleRoot,node),"Payout:Invalid Proof");
```

2.  And `updateDistribution()` function require that `isReadyForPayout == false` so when it's true it cannot be updated  : MerklePayoutStrategyImplementation.sol#updateDistribution()
```solidity
require(isReadyForPayout==false,"Payout: already ready for payout");
```

So there would be no way to distribute funds even for non malicious users using this function then it would lead to a loss of funds for granted projects

```solidity 
  function _distribute(Distribution calldata _distribution) private {
    uint256 _index = _distribution.index;
    address _grantee = _distribution.grantee;
    uint256 _amount = _distribution.amount;
    bytes32 _projectId = _distribution.projectId;
    bytes32[] memory _merkleProof = _distribution.merkleProof;

    require(!hasBeenDistributed(_index), "Payout: Already distributed");

    /* We need double hashing to prevent second preimage attacks */
    bytes32 node = keccak256(bytes.concat(keccak256(abi.encode(_index, _grantee, _amount, _projectId))));

    require(MerkleProof.verify(_merkleProof, merkleRoot, node), "Payout: Invalid proof");

    _setDistributed(_index);

    //@audit-issue no check if _amount is available in the contract

    _transferAmount(payable(_grantee), _amount);

    emit FundsDistributed(
      _amount,
      _grantee,
      tokenAddress,
      _projectId
    );
  }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

- Proper input validation : implement checks to ensure that the amount of tokens provided for payout is effectively owned by the MerklePayoutStrategyImplementation.sol contract to be distributed to the `_granteeAddress`
- Maybe implement a try/catch on _distribute() function that check if the `amount` of token needed is effectively on the contract, and if not continue the process to distribute funds to non malicious grantees
