# `LOCK_DURATION` its impossible to modify because its a constant

## Summary
The `LOCK_DURATION` is a constant set to 0 days, making it impossible to modify in the future.

## Vulnerability Detail

In [IPayoutStrategy.sol#L36](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Gitcoin/blob/main/contracts/contracts/payoutStrategy/IPayoutStrategy.sol#L36), the LOCK_DURATION constant is set to 0 days, as mentioned in the documentation. However, being a constant, means it cannot be changed after the contract is deployed.
This limits the flexibility of the smart contract and might lead to security issues or undesired behavior in the future, as it cannot be updated and always be a zero lock duration. Which has nosense.


## Impact
The `LOCK_DURATION` of the contract will always be `0`

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

If you want it to be always a zero lock duration remove this lines to reduce code complexity;
```diff
diff --git a/contracts/contracts/payoutStrategy/IPayoutStrategy.sol b/contracts/contracts/payoutStrategy/IPayoutStrategy.sol

```

But if you want to change the lock in the future you will might change `LOCK_DURATION` to a state variable;
```diff
diff --git a/contracts/contracts/payoutStrategy/IPayoutStrategy.sol b/contracts/contracts/payoutStrategy/IPayoutStrategy.sol
index 5faa4d6..039c3ae 100644
--- a/contracts/contracts/payoutStrategy/IPayoutStrategy.sol

+  uint256 public LOCK_DURATION = 0 days;
 
   // --- Data ---
```
Also remember to add a function to modify this variable that has a correct **access control** and value limit constrain to avoid an excesive locktime.
