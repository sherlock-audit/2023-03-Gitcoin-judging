# Voting does not use a commit-reveal scheme

## Summary

All votes will be visible during the voting round because voting does not make use of a commit-reveal scheme.

## Vulnerability Detail

Votes are recorded on-chain during a round without any encryption or obfuscation of the vote itself, thus broadcasting the way an address votes before a round is over.

## Impact

Broadcasting users' votes before a voting round ends could potentially suppress participation or influence the way users would vote.

For example, a user, Bob, votes to distribute funds in a way that would be deemed unpopular by other users. Bob may be influenced to vote differently than he would have otherwise because his vote is not obfuscated in any way, and will be broadcasted on-chain for others to see.

## Recommendation

Consider using a commit-reveal scheme for recording votes in a round. This can be accomplished using standards such as [ERC-5732](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5732).
