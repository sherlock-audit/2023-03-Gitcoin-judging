# Lacking single source of truth for grant addresses

## Summary
Difficulty in filtering / verifying legitimate grant addresses for votes

## Vulnerability Detail
The `grantAddress` input for votes is arbitrary. This means that one can submit illegitimate votes by voting for a legitimate project, but have the funds sent to their own wallet address.

While such votes can be filtered off-chain, the question is then the determination of the legitimate grant wallet(s) belonging to the project. Without a single source of truth, it becomes difficult to verify the authenticity of these wallets. Consider the edge cases where a project team member goes rogue / hacked and claims to have an unrecognised wallet be seen as legitimate.

## Impact
Filtering / determining legitimate grant addresses becomes tricky without a single source of truth (preferably on-chain).

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Considering that the code will be deployed on multiple chains, where a project that is registered on one chain can submit applications on another, 1 possible route is to have a registry on each chain. This registry consists of a nested mapping that can only be modified by the project owners:
```solidity
// projectID => grantWallet => authenticity
mapping(bytes32 => mapping(address => bool)) isAuthenticGrantWallet;
```

which can then be used to verify the `grantAddress` used when submitting votes.
```solidity
require(registry.isAuthenticGrantWallet(_projectId, _grantAddress), "invalid grant wallet");
```

The downside is increased complexity in handling consistent states and access controls across multiple chains.
