# Anyone can forcefully apply a project to a round

## Summary
Function `applyToRound` does not verify if the user calling is the authorized user (owners of the project for example). And also there's no function in `RoundImplementation` to remove an application for a project. This leads to anyone can forcefully apply a project to a round.
Project owners should have the right to apply or cancel application to a round

## Vulnerability Detail
The current `applyToRound` function is implemented as below:
```solidity
function applyToRound(bytes32 projectID, MetaPtr calldata newApplicationMetaPtr) external {
    // slither-disable-next-line timestamp
    require(
      applicationsStartTime <= block.timestamp  &&
      block.timestamp <= applicationsEndTime,
      "Round: Applications period not started or over"
    );
    applications.push(Application(projectID, nextApplicationIndex, newApplicationMetaPtr));
    applicationsIndexesByProjectID[projectID].push(nextApplicationIndex);
    emit NewProjectApplication(projectID, nextApplicationIndex, newApplicationMetaPtr);
    nextApplicationIndex++;
  }
```
There is no check if the caller is the owner of the project.
Also there's no functions to remove any application from `applications` variable
## Impact
- Anyone could forcefully apply a project to a round, applying for funds on their behalf without their consent
- Malicious users could discredit the project by providing false `MetaPtr` (application metadata) for them in `applyToRound` function

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
I recommend only allow owners of project to apply for a round and also provide a function allowing to to remove their application
