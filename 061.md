# no check _amout is equal to msg.value

## Summary
when voting there is no check that if _amount is equal to msg.value for native tokens
## Vulnerability Detail
when voting with native tokens a user can specify how much native token they want to vote with, they specify this with the _amount found in encodedVotes.
## Impact
the msg.value could be 0 while the amount is 100 ETH thus taking advantage of the protocol
