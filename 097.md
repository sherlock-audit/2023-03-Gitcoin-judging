# Rounds timestamps are not checked properly

## Summary
When initializing or when calling `updateStartAndEndTimes` the round operator will be able to create/update round to have `applicationsEndTime < roundStartTime`. I will lead to an overlap of application and voting period.

## Vulnerability Detail
When initializing/updating the rounds timestamps the following checks are done:
[RoundImplementation.sol#L223-L242](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Gitcoin/blob/main/contracts/contracts/round/RoundImplementation.sol#L223-L242)
```solidity
    require(
      _initRoundTime.applicationsStartTime >= block.timestamp,
      "Round: Time has already passed"
    );
    require(
      _initRoundTime.applicationsEndTime > _initRoundTime.applicationsStartTime,
      "Round: App end is before app start"
    );
    require(
      _initRoundTime.roundEndTime >= _initRoundTime.applicationsEndTime,
      "Round: Round end is before app end"
    );
    require(
      _initRoundTime.roundEndTime > _initRoundTime.roundStartTime,
      "Round: Round end is before round start"
    );
    require(
      _initRoundTime.roundStartTime >= _initRoundTime.applicationsStartTime,
      "Round: Round start is before app start"
    );
```

However, this checks do not impose the constraint `applicationsEndTime < roundStartTime`.

Example:
- `block.timestamp == 0`
- `applicationsStartTime == 3600`
- `applicationsEndTime == 10800`
- `roundStartTime == 7200`
- `roundEndTime == 14400`

All checks pass successfully for this example with `applicationsEndTime < roundStartTime`.


## Impact
A round with `applicationsEndTime < roundStartTime` will allow projects to apply when voting has already started or vote when applications have not ended.

## Recommendation
Consider adding a check for `applicationsEndTime < roundStartTime`.
