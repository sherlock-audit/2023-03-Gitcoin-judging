# Potential DDos of payout function in MerklePayoutStrategyImplementation.

## Summary
Potential DDos of payout function in MerklePayoutStrategyImplementation.

## Vulnerability Detail
The payout function in MerklePayoutStrategyImplementation is called by the round operator, who pass a list of distributions as a parameter. This list can be of any length, and the function iterates over the list to transfer funds. 
If the passed-in list is too long, it could cause the function to consume more gas than the block gas limit, resulting in revert.

## Impact
Unrestricted iteration and fund transfers could lead to revert, and the round operator may lose gas fees.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
