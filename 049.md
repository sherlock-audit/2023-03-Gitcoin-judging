# Require checks that could have `applicationsEndTime` > `roundStartTime`

## Summary
In RoundImplementation.sol, the require checks of `initialize()` and  `updateStartAndEndTimes()` are inadequate to prevent `applicationsEndTime > roundStartTime`. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The issue lies on those checks are comparing the upper and lower bounds of the application and the round times, but miss out checking whether or not `roundStartTime > applicationsEndTime`.

## Impact
This could lead to voting phase begin while the application phase is still ongoing.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding the following check to the two affected code blocks:

```diff
    require(
      _initRoundTime.applicationsStartTime >= block.timestamp,
      "Round: Time has already passed"
    );
    require(
      _initRoundTime.applicationsEndTime > _initRoundTime.applicationsStartTime,
      "Round: App end is before app start"
    );
    require(
      _initRoundTime.roundEndTime >= _initRoundTime.applicationsEndTime,
      "Round: Round end is before app end"
    );
    require(
      _initRoundTime.roundEndTime > _initRoundTime.roundStartTime,
      "Round: Round end is before round start"
    );
    require(
      _initRoundTime.roundStartTime >= _initRoundTime.applicationsStartTime,
      "Round: Round start is before app start"
    );
+    require(
+      _initRoundTime.roundStartTime >= _initRoundTime.applicationsEndTime,
+      "Round: Round start is before app start"
+    );
```
```diff
    require(newApplicationsStartTime < newApplicationsEndTime, "Round: Application end is before application start");
    require(newRoundStartTime < newRoundEndTime, "Round: Round end is before round start");
    require(newApplicationsStartTime <= newRoundStartTime, "Round: Round start is before application start");
    require(newApplicationsEndTime <= newRoundEndTime, "Round: Round end is before application end");
+    require(newApplicationsEndTime <= newRoundStartTime, "Round: Round end is before application end");
    require(block.timestamp <= newApplicationsStartTime, "Round: Time has already passed");
```
