# Funds locked when roundFeeAddress is not set and round has ended

## Summary
Funds can be locked inside the Round contract when the round ends if roundFeeAddress is not set and is therefore address zero.

## Vulnerability Detail
The RoundImplementation contract doesn't check within the initialize() function that the _roundFeeAddress is not empty.

If it's empty, the Round contract will be created and nothing will happen until the round has ended and the round operator wants to call the setReadyForPayout() function.

If roundFeeAmount is greater than zero and we're using an ERC20 to vote, the Round contract will try to send this fee amount to address zero with the function IERC20(token).safeTransfer() and it will revert.

We won't be able to call the updateRoundFeePercentage() or updateRoundFeeAddress() functions because they both use the roundHasNotEnded modifier.

We won't be able to call the withdraw() function because we can't withdraw the round token.

The tokens will be locked.

**Proof of concept:**
 ```typescript
const roundFeeAddress = ethers.constants.AddressZero;
const roundToken = MockERC20.address;
// Round contract is deployed
// Projects apply and users vote
// Round ends
 await expect(round.connect(roundOperator).setReadyForPayout())
    .to.be.revertedWith("ERC20: transfer to the zero address");

 await expect(round.connect(roundOperator).withdraw(MockERC20.address, account1.address))
    .to.be.revertedWith("Round: Cannot withdraw round token");

 await expect(round.connect(roundOperator).updateRoundFeePercentage(0))
    .to.be.revertedWith("Round: Round has ended");

 await expect(round.connect(roundOperator).updateRoundFeeAddress(account1.address))
    .to.be.revertedWith("Round: Round has ended");

// tokens locked because the round operator cannot withdraw them or change the fee percentage or fee address
expect(await MockERC20.balanceOf(round.address)).to.equal(1_000_000);
```

## Impact
All funds in the Round contract can be locked without the possibility of withdrawing them.

## Tool used

Manual Review, Hardhat

## Recommendation
Add a require inside the initialize() function that checks if _roundFeeAddress is set

   ```solidity
      require(
         _initRoundTime.roundStartTime >= _initRoundTime.applicationsStartTime,
         "Round: Round start is before app start"
      );
+  require(_roundFeeAddress != address(0), "Round: Must set a fee address");


      alloSettings = AlloSettings(_alloSettings);
```
