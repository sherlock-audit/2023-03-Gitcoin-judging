# ERC20 transfer zero amount can be reverted

## Summary
Some ERC20 token implementations have a fee that is charged on each token transfer. This means that the transferred amount isn't exactly what the receiver will get.
## Vulnerability Detail
All functions in the Code snippet below do not have the implementation to track fee on transfer.
There is also no pattern for fee on transfer.
## Impact
A call to IERC20(token).transfer(recipient, 100) with a fee-on-transfer (FOT) of 5% will entitle the recipient with 95 tokens.

## Code Snippet

file contracts/contracts/payoutStrategy/IPayoutStrategy.sol :
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Gitcoin/blob/main/contracts/contracts/payoutStrategy/IPayoutStrategy.sol#L144-L167

```solidity
function withdrawFunds(address payable withdrawAddress) external payable virtual isRoundOperator {

    uint roundEndTime = RoundImplementation(roundAddress).roundEndTime();
    require(block.timestamp >= roundEndTime + LOCK_DURATION, "Lock duration has not ended");


    uint balance = _getTokenBalance();

    if (tokenAddress == address(0)) { 
      /// @dev native token
      AddressUpgradeable.sendValue(
        withdrawAddress,
        balance
      );
    } else { 
      /// @dev ERC20 token
      IERC20Upgradeable(tokenAddress).safeTransfer(//@audit-info
        withdrawAddress,
        balance
      );
    }

    emit FundsWithdrawn(tokenAddress, balance, withdrawAddress);
  }
```

As can be seen from the function nowhere is there a check for zero amount transfer.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Gitcoin/blob/main/contracts/contracts/round/RoundImplementation.sol#L483-L486
```solidity
function withdraw(address tokenAddress, address payable recipent) external onlyRole(ROUND_OPERATOR_ROLE) {
    require(tokenAddress != token, "Round: Cannot withdraw round token");
    _transferAmount(recipent, _getTokenBalance(tokenAddress), tokenAddress);
  }
```

As can be seen from the function itself which also calls _transferAmount() , nowhere is there a check for zero amount transfer.

    if (_tokenAddress == address(0)) {
      Address.sendValue(_recipient, _amount);
    } else {
      IERC20(_tokenAddress).safeTransfer(_recipient, _amount);//@audit-info safeTransfer
    }
  }

    require(MerkleProof.verify(_merkleProof, merkleRoot, node), "Payout: Invalid proof");

    _setDistributed(_index);

    _transferAmount(payable(_grantee), _amount);

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Improve support for FOT type of ERC20. When pulling funds from the user using  `safeTransferFrom`  and  `safeTransfer`  the usual approach is to compare balances pre/post transfer, like so:

```solidity
uint256 balanceBefore = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
IERC20(token).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
uint256 transferred = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this)) - balanceBefore;
```
