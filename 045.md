# Fake round can be attributed to any program

## Summary
The dApp uses the `ownedBy` parameter specified when creating a round in the `create` function of `RoundFactory.sol` to attribute a round to a program. This parameter is not verify and can be used to manipulate (or phish) voters by attributing a fake round to a legitimate program.

## Vulnerability Detail
When the round factory creates a new round the following event is emitted:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Gitcoin/blob/main/contracts/contracts/round/RoundFactory.sol#L102
```solidity
  emit RoundCreated(clone, ownedBy, payable(roundImplementation));
```

This is the only use of the `ownedBy` by parameter, i.e. it is not verified in any way before the event is emitted. The dApp seems to present this value as the actual program which operates the round (the code of the dApp is not in scope but a reference for this claim can be found [here](https://github.com/gitcoinco/grants-stack/blob/2b6aaad752ebfc863c6de0b6b9cd1f2021d3664a/packages/round-manager/src/features/round/ViewRoundPage.tsx#L98)). An attacker can call `create` with the address of an existing program. This can lead to an attacker creating a fake round for a legitimate program to phish users and steal tokens used for voting.

## Impact
Phishing of user of the dApp and breaking the trust relationship between program and rounds.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
If `ownedBy` has a purpose outside the contract (as it seems to have) then it should not be trusted without verification. I would suggest adding a function for round creation in `ProgramImplementation.sol` with the appropriate access control and changing `ownedBy` in `create` to always be `msg.sender`.
