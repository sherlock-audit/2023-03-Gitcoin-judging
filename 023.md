# Reduce protocol fee by setting a small matchAmount

## Summary
Reduce protocol fee by setting a small `matchAmount`
## Vulnerability Detail

In the `setReadyForPayout` function of RoundImplementation.sol, the protocol fee is calculated based on `matchAmount`, while the money transferred to payout is the entire balance of the contract.

```solidity
uint256 protocolFeeAmount = (matchAmount * alloSettings.protocolFeePercentage()) / denominator;
uint256 roundFeeAmount = (matchAmount * roundFeePercentage) / denominator;

fundsInContract = _getTokenBalance(token);

// transfer funds to payout contract
if (token == address(0)) {
    payoutStrategy.setReadyForPayout{value: fundsInContract}();
} else {
    IERC20(token).safeTransfer(address(payoutStrategy), fundsInContract);
    payoutStrategy.setReadyForPayout();
}
```

Since `matchAmount` is set when the Round is created and does not increase with the growth of the balance, a round operator can set a very small `matchAmount` when creating it, while transferring a lot of money to the contract. This way, payout will receive a lot of money but the protocol will receive very little fees.

## Impact
Decrease in protocol fee

## Recommendation
The amount sent to payout cannot exceed matchAmount.
