# Potential DOS Vulnerability in applyToRound Function

## Summary

The `applyToRound()` function within the smart contract is vulnerable to a potential DOS attack, which could make it impossible to find the application indexes for a given projectID.

## Vulnerability Detail

The applyToRound function appends new applications to the applications array and pushes the index to applicationsIndexesByProjectID. However, if there are many applications, the function call to getApplicationIndexesByProjectID could revert due to exceeding the gas limit, making it impossible to find the application indexes. This could result in a denial of service attack on the system.

## Impact

In latest L2 Rollup (optimistic or ZK) as fees are not that expensive it could be easy to disrupt this function by submiting a lot of applications. Even if it's respectable to allow project Applicant to resubmit their application to a project if they are rejected, puting a threshold of 5 application by address per example would be a better usage to ensure there is no malicious applicant

If the system relies heavily on the getApplicationIndexesByProjectID function to process applications or other project implement this function, this vulnerability could have a significant impact on the overall functionality and efficiency of the system. In the worst-case scenario, it could result in a denial of service attack on the system, preventing users from submitting or processing applications altogether.

    // slither-disable-next-line timestamp
    require(
      applicationsStartTime <= block.timestamp  &&
      block.timestamp <= applicationsEndTime,
      "Round: Applications period not started or over"
    );
    applications.push(Application(projectID, nextApplicationIndex, newApplicationMetaPtr));
    applicationsIndexesByProjectID[projectID].push(nextApplicationIndex);
    emit NewProjectApplication(projectID, nextApplicationIndex, newApplicationMetaPtr);
    nextApplicationIndex++;
  } //@audit-issue can suffer DOS and make it impossible to find it's applicationIndexes
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

1.Limit the number of applications that can be submitted for a given projectID. This could involve setting a hard limit on the number of applications that can be submitted, or implementing a dynamic limit based on the current gas limit and the size of the applications array.

2. Implement a more efficient data structure to store the application indexes. For example, a mapping could be used to associate projectIDs with a smaller number of indexes, reducing the likelihood of hitting the gas limit.
