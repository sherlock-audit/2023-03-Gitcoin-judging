# Attackers can apply non-existent/ duplicated projects to rounds

## Summary
Attackers can apply/spam non-existent projects to rounds.
## Vulnerability Detail
Due to lack of checking, any project application will be stored on-chain, even when it is obviously a duplicate or a spam. Attackers can just spam project applications effortlessly to grief reviewers.
## Impact
Since project applications will be reviewed manually, it will cause inconveniences for reviewers.
## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Store application into map to check duplicates. Keys should be hashed as: msg.sender + MetaPtr.protocol + MetaPtr.pointer
