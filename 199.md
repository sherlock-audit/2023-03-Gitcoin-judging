# ProjectRegistry.sol contract has a wrong logic in removeProjectOwner() function.

## Summary
ProjectRegistry.sol contract has a wrong logic in removeProjectOwner() function.

## Vulnerability Detail
Basically this function has a check to prevent (address prevOwner) and (address owner) shouldn't be the same but the problem is that the check line that is implemented in function actually does the opposite.

## Impact

There is some impact:

1.The (require) line made (address prevOwner) and (address owner) meaningless because that checks two addresses should be equal.

2.All owners of the project can remove every owner in the project. For example if a project has 5 owners, the last owner (owner number 5) can remove the first (main) owner. That's problematic.

3. Function doesn't do what it is supposed to do and it could be unexpected behavior.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function removeProjectOwner(uint256 projectID, address prevOwner, address owner) external onlyProjectOwner(projectID) {
        require(owner != address(0) && owner != OWNERS_LIST_SENTINEL, "PR001");

        OwnerList storage owners = projectsOwners[projectID];

        require(owners.list[prevOwner] == owner, "PR003");
        require(owners.count > 1, "PR004");

        owners.list[prevOwner] = owners.list[owner];
        delete owners.list[owner];
        owners.count--;

        emit OwnerRemoved(projectID, owner);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider code with one of below ways:
- require(owners.list[prevOwner] != owner, "PR003");
- or chaning logic of function owners to another strucure
