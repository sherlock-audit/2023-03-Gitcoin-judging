# Lack of check on whether `msg.value` and `_amount` are the same

## Summary
Lack of check on whether `msg.value` and `_amount` are the same
## Vulnerability Detail
In the `QuadraticFundingVotingStrategyImplementation::vote()` function, both native tokens and ERC20 tokens are supported for voting.

However, when the token is a native token, there is no validation of `msg.value` and `_amount`. This means that users can pay less than the value of `_amount`, and the contract will pay the remaining amount.

```solidity
// contracts/contracts/round/RoundImplementation.sol
function vote(bytes[] memory encodedVotes) external payable {
    // slither-disable-next-line timestamp
    require(
      roundStartTime <= block.timestamp &&
      block.timestamp <= roundEndTime,
      "Round: Round is not active"
    );

    votingStrategy.vote{value: msg.value}(encodedVotes, msg.sender); //@audit
  }

function vote(bytes[] calldata encodedVotes, address voterAddress) external override payable nonReentrant isRoundContract {

    /// @dev iterate over multiple donations and transfer funds
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < encodedVotes.length; i++) {

      /// @dev decode encoded vote
      (
        address _token,
        uint256 _amount,
        address _grantAddress,
        bytes32 _projectId
      ) = abi.decode(encodedVotes[i], (
        address,
        uint256,
        address,
        bytes32
      ));

      if (_token == address(0)) {
        /// @dev native token transfer to grant address
        // slither-disable-next-line reentrancy-events
        AddressUpgradeable.sendValue(payable(_grantAddress), _amount);
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to check whether the value of `msg.value` is equal to the value of `_amount`
