# [medium] Extra ETH sent on voting can be stolen by anyone

## Summary
Extra ETH sent on voting can be stolen by anyone

## Vulnerability Detail
When calling `vote` on a RoundImplementation which uses ETH, if `msg.value` is bigger than the `amount` specified in the `encodedVotes` parameter, the difference between the amount sent and specified will just stay in the vote contract. In such a case, anyone will be able to steal that extra ETH from the voting contract by calling `vote` on the RoundImplementation, with the `amount` in the `encodedVotes` equal to the amount of ETH in the vote contract, the `grantAddress` equal to their own address, and passing 0 ETH in the call value. This will send the caller the leftover ETH from the voting contract.

## Recommendation
