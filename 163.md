# Change of phases start times results in inconsistency

## Summary

The round operator can change the start time of round phases as defined in [the documentation](https://docs.allo.gitcoin.co/core-concepts/round) while the phase already started. This creates inconsistencies where votes are not open while some users already voted, or application phase did not start but some projects already applied.

## Vulnerability Detail

Round operator can call `updateStartAndEndTimes` to update timestamp in the future for round phases that have already started.

## Impact

If a round operator mistakenly does that (or it is accidentally done through a racing condition / congested blockchain), the UX/UI of participating in the round could get confusing.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Enforce stricter phases transitions and update of start / end times so that they cannot be updated when on-going.
