# Overlapping round phases

## Summary

The restriction on `applicationsStartTime`, `applicationsEndTime`, `roundStartTime`, and `roundEndTime` in `initialize()` and `updateStartAndEndTimes` allow for overlapping periods of application of voting (resulting in no selection period), contrary to what is described in [the docs](https://docs.allo.gitcoin.co/core-concepts/round).

## Vulnerability Detail

Code checks:

`block.timestamp <= applicationsStartTime < applicationsEndTime <= roundEndTime` 

and

`applicationsStartTime <= roundStartTime < roundEndTime` 

It does not enforce: `applicationsEndTime < roundStartTime`, so it could be that the round starts before the end of the application period. The docs define the "Selection" period as the period in between `applicationsEndTime` and `roundStartTime`. It could be that there is no selection period allowing for round operator to select valid applicants.

## Impact

Round could be deployed / manipulated so that there is no time for the round operator to select valid applicant.
