# `msg.value` not validated in `VotingStrategy:vote()`

## Summary

`msg.value` is not verified in function `vote()` in the VotingStrategy. In case there is some left over of mistakenly sent eth in the voting contract, these fund could be stolen by some voter.

## Vulnerability Detail

In case there is extra or mistakenly sent eth left in the Voting Strategy contract, the left over fund could be stolen by malicious voter. 

Assuming the left over is 1 eth. The voter can just send `encodedVotes` with `_amount` of 1.5 eth, and in the `RoundImplementation.sol#vote()` send 0.5 eth as `msg.value`. In this way, the voter can take the 1 eth difference. Since anyone can call `RoundImplementation.sol#vote()`, the function leaves some chance for bad voters.

The excess eth might come from the same way. When the user sends more than the total amount in the vote. Since `msg.value` is not checked, and the `encodedVotes` array can contain multiple votes at the same time, mistakes could happen.

## Impact

If there is some left over or mistakenly sent eth in the contract, the difference amount could be stolen by malicious voters. 


## Code Snippet


There is no check for the `msg.value` in `QuadraticFundingStrategy.sol#vote()`:

This function just accept whatever `msg.value` sent from the round contract, no matter the total amount match or not:

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

In the voting strategy function `vote()`, calculate the sum of all the `_amount`, add validation for `msg.value` and this sum:
```diff
055:   function vote(bytes[] calldata encodedVotes, address voterAddress) external override payable nonReentrant isRoundContract {
+        uint totalAmount;
058:     for (uint256 i = 0; i < encodedVotes.length; i++) {
059: 
060:       /// @dev decode encoded vote
061:       (
062:         address _token,
063:         uint256 _amount,
064:         address _grantAddress,
065:         bytes32 _projectId
066:       ) = abi.decode(encodedVotes[i], (
067:         address,
068:         uint256,
069:         address,
070:         bytes32
071:       ));
072: 
073:       if (_token == address(0)) {
074:         /// @dev native token transfer to grant address
075:         // slither-disable-next-line reentrancy-events
076:         AddressUpgradeable.sendValue(payable(_grantAddress), _amount);
+            totalAmount += _amount;
077:       } else {

100:     }
+        require(msg.value == totalAmount);
```
