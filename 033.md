# OpenZeppelin standards on _transferAmount function

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

The function should include a return value on its function call to ensure that the status of the transfer are properly aligned. Also, the ERC20 standard states that after the transfer is a successful boolean call, there should be an event emitted to track all such responses. 

## Impact

## Code Snippet

```solidity
/// @notice Util function to transfer amount to recipient
  /// @param _recipient recipient address
  /// @param _amount amount to transfer
  function _transferAmount(address payable _recipient, uint256 _amount) private {
    if (tokenAddress == address(0)) {
      Address.sendValue(_recipient, _amount);
    } else {
      IERC20(tokenAddress).safeTransfer(_recipient, _amount);
    }
  }
```

Change them in such a way: 

```solidity
function transferAmount(address to, uint256 value) external returns (bool);

event Transfer( ..... ) 
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Comply with the standard ERC20 standard by including a bool identifier to track the transfer of the amount. Also, include an Event specifier to catch the transfer amount.
