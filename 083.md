# Payouts can unintentionally be broken by the `RoundImplementation`

## Summary

Calling `setReadyForPayout()` in the `RoundImplementation` prevents any further changes to the distribution in the `MerklePayoutStrategyImplementation`.

## Vulnerability Detail

When a round is complete, an operator is to call `setReadyForPayout()` in the `RoundImplementation` contract to "Pay Protocol & Round Fees and transfer funds to payout contract". At the end of that function execution, `setReadyForPayout()` is called on the payout strategy and funds are sent.

```solidity
if (token == address(0)) {
    payoutStrategy.setReadyForPayout{value: fundsInContract}();
} else {
    IERC20(token).safeTransfer(
        address(payoutStrategy),
        fundsInContract
    );
    payoutStrategy.setReadyForPayout();
}
```

The `setReadyForPayout()` function in the `IPayoutStrategy` interface simply flips an `isReadyForPayout` flag. 

```solidity
function setReadyForPayout() external payable isRoundContract roundHasEnded {
  require(isReadyForPayout == false, "isReadyForPayout already set");
  isReadyForPayout = true;
  emit ReadyForPayout();
}
```

However, as the `MerklePayoutStrategyImplementation` is implemented, there is consequently a major side-effect as the distribution can only be updated if the `isReadyForPayout` flag is false. 

```solidity
function updateDistribution(bytes calldata encodedDistribution) external override roundHasEnded isRoundOperator {

  require(isReadyForPayout == false, "Payout: Already ready for payout");

  (bytes32 _merkleRoot, MetaPtr memory _distributionMetaPtr) = abi.decode(
    encodedDistribution,
    (bytes32, MetaPtr)
  );

  merkleRoot = _merkleRoot;
  distributionMetaPtr = _distributionMetaPtr;

  emit DistributionUpdated(merkleRoot, distributionMetaPtr);
}
```

This creates a situation where the process of managing the early stages of a round from the `RoundImplementation` can prevent necessary functionality in the `PayoutStrategy` from being executed.

These concerns should be separated.

## Impact

The distribution could be unintentionally locked before it has even been initialized or prevent needed edits.

Round operators would have to set up an entirely new round contracts to fix this mistake.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Logic in the `MerklePayoutStrategyImplementation` should be adapted to allow for the distribution to be updated even if the `isReadyForPayout` flag is true.

The distribution should only be locked when the first call to `payout()` is made.

This allows for sending funds to the payout contract and setting the distribution to become separate processes
