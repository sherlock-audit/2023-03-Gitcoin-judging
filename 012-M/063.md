# Grantee addresses can not be updated if payout fails

## Summary

Grantee addresses can not be updated if payout fails 

## Vulnerability Detail

When funds are being distributed, verification is done using `MerkleProof.verify`

```solidity
    require(MerkleProof.verify(_merkleProof, merkleRoot, node), "Payout: Invalid proof");
```

If transfer to the grantee fails, it is impossible to update the grantee address through `updateDistribution` because it requires `isReadyForPayout == false`. The problem is that during a payout, this value has already been set to true.

```solidity
  function updateDistribution(bytes calldata encodedDistribution) external override roundHasEnded isRoundOperator {

    require(isReadyForPayout == false, "Payout: Already ready for payout");
```
There are various reasons a grantee address may need to be updated. E.g, a grantee contract address that is not able to receive certain types of tokens, a compromised grantee address and so on.

This means that an applicant cannot be distributed funds through the payout function.

## Impact

This breaks the payout functionality. This issue is specified as medium because in the long run, funds can be recovered from the contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

There shouldn't be a reason to prevent updating the distribution during payout as the operator is already trusted.
