# The PayoutStrategy contract may end with ETH locked

## Summary
If someone transferred ETH to the PayoutStrategy contract and the token is set, no one will be able to withdraw this ETH from the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
In case, for some reason, someone transferred ETH to the PayoutStrategy contract and the token variable inside the Round contract  is set, this ETH will be locked.

This happens because the PayoutStrategy contract has a receive() function that is payable, but the withdrawFunds() function uses the tokenAddress variable to make the decision whether to send ETH or tokens.

In this way, if tokenAddress is set, the only thing that the round operator will be able to withdraw will be those tokens.
The only possibility for the round operator to withdraw the ETH is if the token address is not set.

**Proof of concept:**
```typescript
  // token is set
  expect(await round.token()).to.equal(MockERC20.address);
  expect(await MockERC20.balanceOf(round.address)).to.equal(1_000_000);

  await round.connect(account1).setReadyForPayout();

  expect(await MockERC20.balanceOf(payoutStrategy.address)).to.equal(999_999);
  expect(await MockERC20.balanceOf(round.address)).to.equal(0);

  await player.sendTransaction({to: payoutStrategy.address, value: ethers.utils.parseEther("1")});
  // Because the token is set, withdrawFunds will only withdraw the token
  await payoutStrategy.connect(account1).withdrawFunds(deployer.address);
  
  // payoutStrategy still has the same amount of ETH
  expect(await ethers.provider.getBalance(payoutStrategy.address)).to.eq(ethers.utils.parseEther("1"));
```

## Impact
Potential loss of ETH if someone transfers ETH to the PayoutStrategy contract and the token is set

## Code Snippet
**IPayoutStrategy.sol**

It has a receive() function, which means it can receive ETH:
[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Gitcoin/blob/main/contracts/contracts/payoutStrategy/IPayoutStrategy.sol#L180](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Gitcoin/blob/main/contracts/contracts/payoutStrategy/IPayoutStrategy.sol#L180)

If tokenAddress is set, it will always transfer tokens when calling the withdrawFunds() function and never transfer ETH:

## Recommendation
**IPayoutStrategy.sol**

Add a require to the receive function, this way once a token is set we will not be able to send ETH to the PayoutStrategy contract:
```solidity
     receive() external payable {
+        require(tokenAddress == address(0), "token already set");
     }
```
Also, we can add a parameter to the withdrawFunds() function so that we can withdraw from the token address we want.
This way we can use the zero address to recover the locked ETH:

```solidity
-   function withdrawFunds(address payable withdrawAddress) external payable virtual isRoundOperator {
+   function withdrawFunds(address payable withdrawAddress, address withdrawToken) external payable virtual isRoundOperator {

        uint roundEndTime = RoundImplementation(roundAddress).roundEndTime();
        require(block.timestamp >= roundEndTime + LOCK_DURATION, "Lock duration has not ended");


-      uint balance = _getTokenBalance();
+      uint balance = _getTokenBalance(withdrawToken);

-      if (tokenAddress == address(0)) { 
+      if (withdrawToken == address(0)) { 
           AddressUpgradeable.sendValue(
               withdrawAddress,
               balance
           );
       } else { 
           IERC20Upgradeable(withdrawToken).safeTransfer(
-              tokenAddress,
+              withdrawToken,
               balance
           );
        }

-       emit FundsWithdrawn(withdrawToken, balance, tokenAddress);
+       emit FundsWithdrawn(withdrawToken, balance, withdrawToken);
    }
```

Modify the _getTokenBalance() function making it possible to use a token address as a parameter:
```solidity
-     function _getTokenBalance() internal view returns (uint) {
+     function _getTokenBalance(address _tokenAddress) internal view returns (uint) {
          if (_tokenAddress == address(0)) {
               return address(this).balance;
           } else {
               return IERC20Upgradeable(_tokenAddress).balanceOf(address(this));
          }
    }
```
