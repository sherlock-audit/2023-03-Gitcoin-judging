# Voting can start before Application Ends.

## Summary
As per the docs, this is the logical way of how the protocol works. 
First, Application start  phase ==> application end phase  ==> round starts ==> round ends.
This logic is enforced in the initializer of the round contract by the program owner.

## Vulnerability Detail
The above logic is wrong . 
Example : 
Suppose , 
- Round End time is 1000 .
- Round Start time is 650.
- Application End Time is 700 . 
- Application Start Time is 600.

Going through the constraints in the initializer. 

```solidity
require(
      _initRoundTime.applicationsEndTime > _initRoundTime.applicationsStartTime,
      "Round: App end is before app start"
    );
```

700 > 600 . Hence true


```solidity
 require(
      _initRoundTime.roundEndTime >= _initRoundTime.applicationsEndTime,
      "Round: Round end is before app end"
    );
```
1000 > 700 ==> true.

```solidity
require(
      _initRoundTime.roundEndTime > _initRoundTime.roundStartTime,
      "Round: Round end is before round start"
    );
```
1000 > 650 . hence true.

```solidity
require(
      _initRoundTime.roundStartTime >= _initRoundTime.applicationsStartTime,
      "Round: Round start is before app start"
    );
```
650 > 600 . Hence true.

## Impact
Users can start voting before application deadline is passed. Thus impacting decisions significantly.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
```solidity
 require(
      _initRoundTime.applicationsEndTime > _initRoundTime.applicationsStartTime,
      "Round: App end is before app start"
    );
// No need for this check below
 -   require(
 -     _initRoundTime.roundEndTime >= _initRoundTime.applicationsEndTime,
 -     "Round: Round end is before app end"
 -   );
 
    require(
      _initRoundTime.roundEndTime > _initRoundTime.roundStartTime,
      "Round: Round end is before round start"
    );
    require(
-      _initRoundTime.roundStartTime >= _initRoundTime.applicationsStartTime,
+      _initRoundTime.roundStartTime >= _initRoundTime.applicationsEndTime,
      "Round: Round start is before app start"
    );
