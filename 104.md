# _transferAmount function in RoundImplementation.sol doesn't have a non zero check on _amount parameter

## Summary
_transferAmount function in RoundImplementation.sol doesn't have a non zero check on _amount parameter &  withdrawFunds function in IPayoutStratergy.sol doesn't have a non zero check on account balance  
## Vulnerability Detail
_transferAmount function in RoundImplementation.sol doesn't have a non zero check on _amount parameter

## Impact
There's no reason to prevent it. If you want to transfer 0 tokens it is meaningless operation but it doesn't produce any harm. You will be paying the transaction fee.
For example it is allowed to transfer 0 ethers. It doesn't make much sense but you still have to pay the transaction fee. They are used to override stuck transactions with lowers fees.
