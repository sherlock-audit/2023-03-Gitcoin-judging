# Lack of ownedBy Parameter Validation Leads to Creation of Illegitimate Rounds

## Summary
The current implementation of the RoundFactory's create function does not validate the ownedBy parameter, allowing anyone to create fake or malicious rounds on behalf of the program.
## Vulnerability Detail
When a program is created, it is expected that the RoundFactory's create function will be called with the ownedBy parameter set to the program address. This enables The Graph to capture the event and index it off-chain as a legitimate round created by the program. However, there are no checks on the ownedBy parameter in the create function, which means that anyone can create fake or malicious rounds on behalf of the program and deceive the system. The Graph will index these rounds as legitimate since it only verifies the ownedBy address emitted in the event. A malicious actor can create numerous fake rounds to confuse applicants and potentially manipulate payout and voting strategies to make them exploitable. Since cloning is a relatively inexpensive action, an attacker could also spam the system with numerous rounds that appear legitimate, causing confusion among participants.
## Impact
Due to the project's heavy reliance on The Graph for off-chain event indexing, this vulnerability could result in chaos for end-users. It is crucial for end-users to have a method for verifying whether a round is genuinely owned by the program and should be considered valid. Given the unintended nature of this behavior, I would classify this finding as medium severity.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Validate the `ownedBy` parameter with `msg.sender` so that only program operator can create valid rounds
