# Rounds can be created under a program without consent

## Summary

Any user can deploy a round that is owned by a program they are not associated with. This can create the impression that the round is affiliated with the program, even though it is not.

## Vulnerability Detail

When a round is created the user passes in the `encodedParameters` for the round and an `owner` address. 

The `owner` parameter is documented as the `Program which created the contract`

However, there is no validation that whoever is deploying the round is actually a program operator. This means that a user could deploy a round that is owned by a program they are not associated with.

```solidity
    function create(
        bytes calldata encodedParameters,
        address ownedBy
    ) external returns (address) {
        require(roundImplementation != address(0), "roundImplementation is 0x");
        require(alloSettings != address(0), "alloSettings is 0x");

        address clone = ClonesUpgradeable.clone(roundImplementation);

        emit RoundCreated(clone, ownedBy, payable(roundImplementation));

        IRoundImplementation(payable(clone)).initialize(
            encodedParameters,
            alloSettings
        );

        return clone;
    }
```

## Impact

This can create the impression that the round is affiliated with the program, even though it is not. Undue credibility could be given to the round by outside participants.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Include a check in the create function that verifies that the message sender is a program operator.
