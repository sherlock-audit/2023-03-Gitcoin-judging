# cross-chain replay on the factory contracts is possible with the use of `clone`

## Summary
cross-chain replay on the all factory contract is possible with the use of `clone`

## Vulnerability Detail
in the function create(),  the `ClonesUpgradeable.clone()` would call `create()` to deploy a new proxy for the implmentation contract, calculating the address by `hash(nonce, bytecode)`. This is susceptible for cross-chain replay attack which led to the OP/wintermute attack. 

Even though there is no explicit specification that tells the user Round/Program contract can be used across different chains (same with GnosisSafe), but this is a susceptible fallacy that some users might have and have the possibility to fall pray to

## Impact
Bad user experience

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider using the updated approach of `createProxyWithNonce` from Gnosis, by allowing the creator to pass an arbitrary salt into the function and use [cloneDeterministic](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/62aa67491a9b46a21c2b5e3600560150a2710f98/contracts/proxy/ClonesUpgradeable.sol) instead of `clone()`
