# Fund distribution payout will revert if the receiver address does not support ETH or the receiver is in blocklist

## Summary

Fund distribution payout will revert if the receiver address does not support ETH or the receiver is in blocklist

## Vulnerability Detail

Fund distribution payout will revert if the receiver address does not support ETH or the receiver is in blocklist

We are calling

```solidity
function payout(Distribution[] calldata _distributions) external virtual payable isRoundOperator {
  require(isReadyForPayout == true, "Payout: Not ready for payout");

  for (uint256 i = 0; i < _distributions.length; ++i) {
    _distribute(_distributions[i]);
  }
```

then calling _distribute

```solidity
 _transferAmount(payable(_grantee), _amount);
```

calling

```solidity
/// @notice Util function to transfer amount to recipient
/// @param _recipient recipient address
/// @param _amount amount to transfer
function _transferAmount(address payable _recipient, uint256 _amount) private {
  if (tokenAddress == address(0)) {
    Address.sendValue(_recipient, _amount);
  } else {
    IERC20(tokenAddress).safeTransfer(_recipient, _amount);
  }
}
```

however, if the recipient address is a smart contract that does not support ETH receiving if the payout token is in ETH, transaction revert.

 or if the recipient is a blocklisted address in USDC blocked list, the whole distribution payout transaction revert.

## Impact

Fund distribution payout will revert if the receiver address does not support ETH or the receiver is in blocklist

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend the protocol whitelist the token used to distribute the fund and then use isContract function call to check if the recipient is a smart contract address.
