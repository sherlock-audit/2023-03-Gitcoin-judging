# A round can be created not according to the docs, so users can select or vote at the time they are not supposed to.

## Summary
According to the [docs](https://docs.allo.gitcoin.co/core-concepts/round#rounds-in-depth), these are timestamps

But in the code they are not validating properly
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
    // slither-disable-next-line timestamp
    require(
      _initRoundTime.applicationsStartTime >= block.timestamp,
      "Round: Time has already passed"
    );
    require(
      _initRoundTime.applicationsEndTime > _initRoundTime.applicationsStartTime,
      "Round: App end is before app start"
    );
    require(
      _initRoundTime.roundEndTime >= _initRoundTime.applicationsEndTime,
      "Round: Round end is before app end"
    );
    require(
      _initRoundTime.roundEndTime > _initRoundTime.roundStartTime,
      "Round: Round end is before round start"
    );
    require(
      _initRoundTime.roundStartTime >= _initRoundTime.applicationsStartTime,
      "Round: Round start is before app start"
    );
```
[/contracts/round/RoundImplementation.sol#L223](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Gitcoin/blob/main/contracts/contracts/round/RoundImplementation.sol#L223)
E.x. `roundStartTime` can start before `applicationsEndTime`, `roundEndTime` can be equal to `applicationsEndTime` from the third require.
## Impact
A round can be created not according to the docs, so users can select or vote at the time they are not supposed to.
## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
I think it will be better to refactor and use the structure from the docs:
```diff
    require(
      _initRoundTime.applicationsStartTime >= block.timestamp,
      "Round: Time has already passed"
    );
    require(
      _initRoundTime.applicationsEndTime > _initRoundTime.applicationsStartTime,
      "Round: App end is before app start"
    );
    require(
-      _initRoundTime.roundEndTime >= _initRoundTime.applicationsEndTime,
+      _initRoundTime.roundStartTime >= _initRoundTime.applicationsEndTime,
      "Round: Round end is before app end"
    );
    require(
      _initRoundTime.roundEndTime > _initRoundTime.roundStartTime,
      "Round: Round end is before round start"
    );
-    require(
-      _initRoundTime.roundStartTime >= _initRoundTime.applicationsStartTime, // this unnecessary
-      "Round: Round start is before app start"
-    );

```
