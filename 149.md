# Funds can get stuck in Payout strategy

## Summary
The `IPayoutStrategy` abstract contract implements the `receive()` function but has no way of rescuing mistakenly sent funds to it. This is considered and implemented in `RoundImplementation.sol` but missing in `IPayoutStrategy`.

## Vulnerability Detail
If we take the `MerklePayoutStrategyImplementation` contract for example which also does not implement any rescue funds functions we can get into a position with funds stuck in the contract. If the PayoutStrategy is initialized with a non-native token, any native tokens mistakenly sent to the implementation contract will be lost.

## Impact
Incorrectly sent funds can get stuck in contracts that inherit from `IPayoutStrategy` if no rescue function is implemented.

## Code Snippet
[IPayoutStrategy.sol L180](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Gitcoin/blob/main/contracts/contracts/payoutStrategy/IPayoutStrategy.sol#L180) implements the `receive()` function but no functions for recovery.
```solidity
  receive() external payable {}
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider following the same practice that you used for `RoundImplementation.sol` and implement a rescue function for such scenarios.

Another way is also to remove the `receive()` function from the abstract contract and instead leave the funds handling implementation to the implementing contracts.
