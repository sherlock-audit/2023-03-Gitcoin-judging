# Withdraw funds can start when round has not ended.

## Summary
withdrawFunds inside `IPayoutStrategy` can start when the round has not ended.
## Vulnerability Detail

Here is validation for the round's end in RoundImplementation
```solidity
  modifier roundHasEnded() {
    // slither-disable-next-line timestamp
    require(block.timestamp > roundEndTime, "Round: Round has not ended");
    _;
  }
```
[round/RoundImplementation.sol#L84](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Gitcoin/blob/main/contracts/contracts/round/RoundImplementation.sol#L84)
Here is implementation of withdraw funds. As you can see lock duration is 0, so require will be `block.timestamp >= roundEndTime` which contradict round implementation.
```solidity
  uint256 public constant LOCK_DURATION = 0 days;
...
  function withdrawFunds(address payable withdrawAddress) external payable virtual isRoundOperator {

    uint roundEndTime = RoundImplementation(roundAddress).roundEndTime();
    require(block.timestamp >= roundEndTime + LOCK_DURATION, "Lock duration has not ended");


    uint balance = _getTokenBalance();

```

## Impact
Protocol does not work as intended.

## Recommendation
```diff
  function withdrawFunds(address payable withdrawAddress) external payable virtual isRoundOperator {

    uint roundEndTime = RoundImplementation(roundAddress).roundEndTime();
-    require(block.timestamp >= roundEndTime + LOCK_DURATION, "Lock duration has not ended");
+    require(block.timestamp > roundEndTime + LOCK_DURATION, "Lock duration has not ended");


    uint balance = _getTokenBalance();

    if (tokenAddress == address(0)) { 
      /// @dev native token
      AddressUpgradeable.sendValue(
        withdrawAddress,
        balance
      );
    } else { 
      /// @dev ERC20 token
      IERC20Upgradeable(tokenAddress).safeTransfer(
        withdrawAddress,
        balance
      );
    }

    emit FundsWithdrawn(tokenAddress, balance, withdrawAddress);
  }
```
