# Failed transfer with low level call could be overlooked

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
According to the Solidity docs, "The low-level functions call, delegatecall and staticcall return true as their first return value if the account called is non-existent, as part of the design of the EVM. Account existence must be checked prior to calling if needed".
As a result, it is possible that this call will not work but _call will not notice anything went wrong. 
## Impact
In case, if the receive address will be the contract that have not yet been deployed or have been destroyed,
call will return success even though no transfer was executed.

```solidity
function _transferAmount(address payable _recipient, uint256 _amount) private {
    if (tokenAddress == address(0)) {
      Address.sendValue(_recipient, _amount);
...
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
When batch distribute funds to recipients, make sure to check that payable address can be contract, and it is actually existing before calling it.
