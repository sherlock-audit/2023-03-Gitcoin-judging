# The user can vote using both ETH and tokens, and the ETH remains in the Round contract when the setReadyForPayout() is called

## Summary
User can vote using both ETH and tokens but when the setReadyForPayout() function is called, the ETH used to vote remains in the Round contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
I use tokens to cast 1_000_000 votes and ETH to cast another 1_000_000 votes. 

Both the tokens and ETH were sent to the Round contract but the problem arises when the round ends and the round operator calls the setReadyForPayout() function.

At that time, the tokens were sent to the PayoutStrategy contract because the Round contract has a token set, but the ETH remains inside the Round.

**Proof of concept:**
```typescript
  await MockERC20.connect(player).approve(votingStrategy.address, 1_000_000);

  createVote = async (tokenAddress) => ethers.utils.defaultAbiCoder.encode(
      ["address", "uint256", "address", "bytes32"],
      [
          tokenAddress,
          1_000_000,
          round.address,
          ethers.utils.hexZeroPad(projectID.toHexString(), 32),
      ]
  );
  
  await round.connect(player).vote([
      // One vote with ERC20
      await createVote(MockERC20.address),
      // One vote with ETH
      await createVote(ethers.constants.AddressZero)
  ],
  { value: 1_000_000 }
  );

  await ethers.provider.send("evm_mine", [_currentBlockTimestamp + 1_000]);

  await round.connect(roundOperator).setReadyForPayout();


  // The tokens were transferred to the payoutStrategy contract but ETH is still in the Round contract
  expect(await MockERC20.balanceOf(payoutStrategy.address)).to.equal(999_999);
  expect(await MockERC20.balanceOf(round.address)).to.equal(0);
  expect(await ethers.provider.getBalance(payoutStrategy.address)).to.equal(0);
  expect(await ethers.provider.getBalance(round.address)).to.equal(1_000_000);
```

## Impact
First, I think it is not a desired feature that a user can vote with ETH when a token is set.

Second, even though the funds can be recovered, the payment process is messed up because the round operator will have to withdraw the ETH from the Round contract, exchange them for the desired tokens and send them to the payoutStrategy contract.

## Code Snippet
RoundImplementation.sol

Vote() allows to send a msg.value even when a token is set:

setReadyForPayout() only send the ETH to the PayoutStrategy contract when a token is NOT set:
[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Gitcoin/blob/main/contracts/contracts/round/RoundImplementation.sol#L443-L478](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Gitcoin/blob/main/contracts/contracts/round/RoundImplementation.sol#L443-L478)


QuadraticFundingVotingStrategyImplementation.sol

Doesn't check msg.value at any time:

## Tool used

Manual Review, Hardhat

## Recommendation
Add a require within the Round contract vote() function that disallows sending msg.value when a token is set.

```solidity
function vote(bytes[] memory encodedVotes) external payable {
    // slither-disable-next-line timestamp
    require(
    roundStartTime <= block.timestamp &&
    block.timestamp <= roundEndTime,
    "Round: Round is not active"
    );

+   if (token != address(0)) {
+      require(msg.value == 0, "Round: Can't vote with ETH because a token is set");
+   }

    votingStrategy.vote{value: msg.value}(encodedVotes, msg.sender);
}
```
