# `applyToRound` doesn't verify whether a `projectID` exists

## Summary

Votes can be submitted for a `projectID` while not sending funds to the correct grantee

## Vulnerability Detail

When voting, the voter is allowed to specify the `_projectId` and `_grantAddress` in the `encodedVotes`

```solidity
 function vote(bytes[] calldata encodedVotes, address voterAddress) external override payable nonReentrant isRoundContract {

    /// @dev iterate over multiple donations and transfer funds
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < encodedVotes.length; i++) {

      /// @dev decode encoded vote
      (
        address _token,
        uint256 _amount,
        address _grantAddress,
        bytes32 _projectId
      ) = abi.decode(encodedVotes[i], (
        address,
        uint256,
        address,
        bytes32
      ));

      if (_token == address(0)) {
        /// @dev native token transfer to grant address
        // slither-disable-next-line reentrancy-events
        AddressUpgradeable.sendValue(payable(_grantAddress), _amount);
      } else {

        /// @dev erc20 transfer to grant address
        // slither-disable-next-line arbitrary-send-erc20,reentrancy-events,
        SafeERC20Upgradeable.safeTransferFrom(
          IERC20Upgradeable(_token),
          voterAddress,
          _grantAddress,
          _amount
        );

      }
```

The issue is that there is no check to verify that the `_grantAddress` is tied to a certain `_projectId` in the contract.

The voter could therefore vote while sending funds to themselves, to another address or to another _projectId.
This would make the protocols vote calculation difficult and error prone. For instance if they check the events emitted for a `_projectId`, it wouldn't be a guarantee that the  `_projectId` actually received funds.

## Impact

This would break the voting process unnecessarily because although this can be resolved off-chain, the smart contract should prevent this.

## Recommendation

Implement a mapping of projectIDs and Addresses to verify they match during voting.
