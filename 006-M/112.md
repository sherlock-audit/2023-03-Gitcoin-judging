# Users Can Emit Infinite Vote Events With Same Capital (Events are relied-on for payout calculation off-chain)

## Summary

The `QuadraticFundingVotingStrategyImplementation.sol:vote()` function allows users to specify an address they control as the `_grantAddress` while attributing these contributions to any `_projectId` in the emitted event. A malicious user can send funds to themself, while still emitting a seemingly-valid `Voted` event for the "wash vote". This loophole could enable a user to vote infinitely with the same initial capital through incorrect event emission. Emission of incorrect / infinite `Voted` events is problematic in this case because the voting implementation relies on parsing these events (via Graph) to calculate the round's payout distribution. 

## Vulnerability Detail

`Voted` events have the following format:
```solidity
    /// @notice Emitted when a new vote is sent
    event Voted(
        address token, // voting token
        uint256 amount, // voting amount
        address indexed voter, // voter address
        address grantAddress, // grant address
        bytes32 indexed projectId, // project id
        address indexed roundAddress // round address
    );
```

Usually incorrect event emission is low risk, but in this case there were a few factors that led to me submitting this issue:
1. The team stated these events are relied-on for calculating round votes and payouts.
2. The only way to tie a `projectId` to its appropriate grant addresses is via off-chain metadata. 
3. The [example metadata](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/QmPMERYmqZtbHmqd2UzRhX9F4cixnMQU2GFa2hYAsQ6J3D) from the [docs](https://docs.allo.gitcoin.co/core-concepts/project-registry) did not include `grantAddresses` as part of the metadata
4. The spoof-able `projectId` is indexed in `Voted` events while `grantAddress` is not, which leads me to believe `projectId` is the intended 'primary identifier'. 

## Impact
Medium/Low (even if low, team should be made aware it is a possible angle for vote manipulation)

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. Do not use solely `projectId` as an primary key when calculating vote winners (use `projectId` + `grantAddress`)
2. Provide a way for a project to link its approved grantAddresses on-chain
