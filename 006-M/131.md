# Users can use worthless/customized tokens to vote

## Summary
Users can use worthless/customized tokens to vote
## Vulnerability Detail
As for now, users can vote with any erc20 token. They can just create their own token, mint a huge amount and then use it to vote. Or they can just implement a 'fake' transferFrom that does nothing but emit fake transfer events.
## Impact
It will cause a lot of trouble when checking votes. Even with support tools such as Dune, there will be hard to filter legit votes when the amount of votes is huge.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement token whitelist. Any votes with tokens which are not in the whitelist should be rejected.
