# Native token is left in VotingStrategy contract if user votes with value but _token is not address(0)

## Summary

If user calling [RoundImplementation.vote](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Gitcoin/blob/main/contracts/contracts/round/RoundImplementation.sol#L430) with value but `_token` is not address(0) then the value will be left in VotingStrategy contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

 [RoundImplementation.vote](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Gitcoin/blob/main/contracts/contracts/round/RoundImplementation.sol#L430) is a payable function. If voter calls this function with value but _token param is not address(0) but another ERC20 token then the value will be left in QuadraticFundingVotingStrategyImplementation.

## Impact
Native token is left in QuadraticFundingVotingStrategyImplementation contract, though next user can call vote to exploit it by specify a fake `_grantAddress`

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Revert if msg.value > 0 but _token is ERC20.

```solidity
} else {

        require(msg.value == 0, "_token is not address(0)");     // =======> add require here

        /// @dev erc20 transfer to grant address
        // slither-disable-next-line arbitrary-send-erc20,reentrancy-events,
        SafeERC20Upgradeable.safeTransferFrom(
          IERC20Upgradeable(_token),
          voterAddress,
          _grantAddress,
          _amount
        );

      }
```
