# Amount validation during transfer function call

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

The transferAmount function doesn't take into account if zero amount is transferred to. It also doesn't check if the amount to be transferred to are sufficiently available.

## Impact

Medium 

## Code Snippet
```solidity
/// @notice Util function to transfer amount to recipient
  /// @param _recipient recipient address
  /// @param _amount amount to transfer
  function _transferAmount(address payable _recipient, uint256 _amount) private {
    if (tokenAddress == address(0)) {
      Address.sendValue(_recipient, _amount);
    } else {
      IERC20(tokenAddress).safeTransfer(_recipient, _amount);
    }
  }
```
