# setReadyForPayout() function in IPayoutStrategy doesn't emit an ReadyForPayout() event which can be an issue in logging during debugging

## Summary
setReadyForPayout() function in IPayoutStrategy is not emitting isReadyForPayout value properly
## Vulnerability Detail
ReadyForPayout() event is defined without any parameters which on emit shows empty logs
```solidity
/// @notice Emitted when contract is ready for payout
  event ReadyForPayout();

  /// @notice Invoked by RoundImplementation to set isReadyForPayout
  function setReadyForPayout() external payable isRoundContract roundHasEnded {
    require(isReadyForPayout == false, "isReadyForPayout already set");
    isReadyForPayout = true;
    emit ReadyForPayout(); @audit: this doesn't emit anything in the function call and is redundant code, this event should emit something or should be removed
  }
```
## Impact
When setReadyForPayout() is called the logs won't be visible as the emit event doesn't emit anything
eg: There are the logs of the setReadyForPayout() call, where the isReadyForPayout is set to true, but the logs are not captured.

## Tool used
Manual Review, Remix for testing

## Recommendation
Emit isReadyForPayout in the event for better tracking using the logs.
```solidity
event ReadyForPayout(bool isReadyForPayout);
emit ReadyForPayout(isReadyForPayout);
```

Eg: Logs after emit with isReadyForPayout
```solidity
[
	{
		"from": "0xfB72aAdB17a855D27A68B565ee0a84CB30A387e4",

		"event": "ReadyForPayout",
		"args": {
			"0": true,
			"isReadyForPayout": true
		}
	}
]
```
