# fund could be stuck in MerklePayoutStrategy if payout is set to be ready before updateDistribution

## Summary
fund could be stuck in MerklePayoutStrategy if payout is set to be ready before updateDistribution

## Vulnerability Detail
`updateDistribution()` can only be called after RoundHasEnded, but before the `isReadyForPayout` bool is set to be true;
However, the `isReadyForPayout` could be set to true anytime after the RoundHasEnded returns true and the roundOperator call the `setReadyForPayout`. 

## Impact
Fund could be stuck in the payoutStrategy, if the `setReadyForPayout` is called before the updateDistribution is finalised. There is no control or protection against such scenario, nor fund recoverable.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Create an additional boolean check on `setReadyForPayout` to make sure distribution is updated:

```solidity
  function setReadyForPayout() external payable isRoundContract roundHasEnded {
    require(isReadyForPayout == false, "isReadyForPayout already set");
+++    require(isDistributionUpdated, "DistributionNotReady");
    isReadyForPayout = true;
    emit ReadyForPayout();
  }
```
