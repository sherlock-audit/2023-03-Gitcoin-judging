# Potential Issue with Function Execution Order in Payout Strategy Contracts

## Summary
The execution order of the updateDistribution and setReadyForPayout functions is critical in ensuring the proper distribution of funds. If setReadyForPayout is called before updateDistribution, funds may get stuck, leading to a catastrophic scenario.
## Vulnerability Detail
The updateDistribution function in payout strategy contracts must be called before invoking the setReadyForPayout function in the rounds. Both functions currently have the same modifier, which only checks if the round has ended. If setReadyForPayout is called before updateDistribution, the Merkle root will not be set. As a result, the funds collected in the round will not be distributed to the grant addresses, leading to a catastrophic scenario.

## Impact
Both functions are restricted to the PROGRAM_OPERATOR role, so a malicious actor cannot interfere. However, since these functions are critical in the flow, a program operator might mistakenly call setReadyForPayout before updating the distribution, causing the funds to be stuck. The only way to recover the funds is for the round operator to wait until roundEndTime + LOCK_DURATION and then withdraw the funds to a safe wallet before proceeding. In my opinion, this is a valid finding, but since there is a way to recover the funds, I will label it as medium severity.
## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Gitcoin/blob/main/contracts/contracts/payoutStrategy/MerklePayoutStrategy/MerklePayoutStrategyImplementation.sol#L60-L75
needs the isReadyForPayout == false

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Gitcoin/blob/main/contracts/contracts/round/RoundImplementation.sol#L443-L478
makes the isReadyForPayout == true in the merkle payout contract 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Gitcoin/blob/main/contracts/contracts/payoutStrategy/IPayoutStrategy.sol#L144-L167
only way to recover the stucked funds is calling this function and distribute it again. You need to wait some time after round end tho
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Put a check that if distribution is not updated in payout strategy round can't finalize the round
