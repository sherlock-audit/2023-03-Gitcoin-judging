# Funds locked in MerklePayoutStrategyImplementation when merkleRoot = 0

## Summary

To distribute grants via the payout strategy contract, the round operator is supposed to call `updateDistribution()` to provide info about the distribution before calling `setReadyForPayout()` (via the round implementation). If they do it the other way around, the `updateDistribution()` call will revert and the contract will be locked in a state where `merkleRoot = 0` preventing any distribution.

## Vulnerability Detail

`updateDistribution()` requires `isReadyForPayout == false` and sets the value of `merkleRoot` to the one given as argument.

If `setReadyForPayout()` is called first, it will set `isReadyForPayout` to true, and prevent setting the merkleRoot.

The distribution of tokens checks: `require(MerkleProof.verify(_merkleProof, merkleRoot, node), "Payout: Invalid proof")` which will fail when merkleRoot is 0, preventing any withdrawal.

## Impact

If the node operator call the function in the wrong order, funds will be locked in the contract and distribution will be impossible. There could be multiple node operators, one responsible for calling `setReadyForPayout()` and another one responsible for calling `updateDistribution()`. It could easily be that their transactions get reorged by block builders resulting in this scenario even when round operators were cautious.

The node operator will need to withdraw all the funds to a custom address and distribute it themselves / restart a new round.
