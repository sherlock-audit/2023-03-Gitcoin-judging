# Protocol fees can be bypassed

## Summary
A round operator can use the protocol without paying protocol fess due to rounding and missing checks in the function `setReadyForPayout` in `RoundImplementation.sol`.

## Vulnerability Detail
A round consists of a matching fund denoted `matchAmount` which is distributed to grant applicants according to the votes casted during the round. Protocols fees define globally in `alloSettings.protocolFeePercentage()` and round fees are deducted as some fixed percentage of the matching fund.

When `setReadyForPayout` is called, those calculations are performed and the assets are transferred to the payout strategy as seen in the following code snippet:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Gitcoin/blob/main/contracts/contracts/round/RoundImplementation.sol#L466-L475
```solidity
  // update funds in contract after fee deduction
  fundsInContract = _getTokenBalance(token);

  // transfer funds to payout contract
  if (token == address(0)) {
    payoutStrategy.setReadyForPayout{value: fundsInContract}();
  } else {
    IERC20(token).safeTransfer(address(payoutStrategy), fundsInContract);
    payoutStrategy.setReadyForPayout();
  }
```

Observe that the payout uses the total balance of the contract instead of `matchAmount` while the fees are calculated using ``matchAmount`:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Gitcoin/blob/main/contracts/contracts/round/RoundImplementation.sol#L447-L448
```solidity
  uint256 protocolFeeAmount = (matchAmount * alloSettings.protocolFeePercentage()) / denominator;
  uint256 roundFeeAmount = (matchAmount * roundFeePercentage) / denominator;
```

Since the parameters `matchAmount` and `roundFeePercentage` are controlled by the round operator and not sufficiently validated, a malicious operator can perform the following:

- Set `matchAmount` to be less than `denominator / alloSettings.protocolFeePercentage()` which would result in the protocol fee rounding down to zero.
- Set `roundFeePercentage` to more than 100% (in terms of `denominator`) to receive "normal" round fees (this is optional).
- Transfer the matching fund directly to the contract (it even has an empty payable `receive` function) which will change the balance used when finalizing the round but will not be reflected in `matchAmount`.

This would result in a round which bypasses protocol fees but functions regularly otherwise.

## Impact
Loss of fees for the protocol.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The fix is not a localized code update. I would suggest to consider the fact that both the contract balance and `matchAmount` are used to represent the matching fund, i.e. they are a single logical entity. The code should reflect that and only use one of them to avoid inconsistency.

Moreover, the `RoundImplementation.sol` lacks basic checks for parameters controlled by the round operator. I am aware that the operator is considered a trusted entity (and is not incentivized to sabotage the round itself) but I would look at the contract again considering the fact that a round operator can damage either the protocol or users by being malicious or just not careful enough.
