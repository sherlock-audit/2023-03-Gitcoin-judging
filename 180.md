# inconsistent logic in `removeProjectOwner` and `getProjectOwners`

## Summary

Unclear whether a project can have no owners.

## Vulnerability Detail

The checks in https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Gitcoin/blob/main/contracts/contracts/projectRegistry/ProjectRegistry.sol#L165-L167 seem unnecessary because of https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Gitcoin/blob/main/contracts/contracts/projectRegistry/ProjectRegistry.sol#L132 which require that there be at least one owner after deletion.
