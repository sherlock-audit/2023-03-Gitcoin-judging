# If an exception occurs in _transferAmount, MerklePayoutStrategyImplementation.payout will fail

## Summary

`MerklePayoutStrategyImplementation.payout` accepts an array parameter containing multiple Distribution structures. The function internally calls `_distribute` to process each Distribution. If an error occurs while processing one Distribution, the entire transaction will revert.

## Vulnerability Detail

There are two scenarios to describe here:

1.  If \_token == address(0), \_recipient is **a contract that does not implement fallback or receive**, then sending ether to _recipient will revert.
2.  If _token is **an erc20 token with a blacklist mechanism** (such as usdt), and \_recipient happens to be in the blacklist, then sending tokens to \_recipient will also be revert.

When RoundOperator calls `MerklePayoutStrategyImplementation.payout` to send funds to multiple projects, he does not know whether the address to send will cause an exception. Eventually, funds may not be distributed.

## Impact

`MerklePayoutStrategyImplementation.payout` may fail, preventing funds from being distributed to projects.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add a try-catch where _transferAmount is called.
