# Amount is inconsistent when voting with native tokens

## Summary
In `QuadraticFundingVotingStrategyImplementation.sol` there is no validation that the amounts in `encodedVotes` are consistent with the sent `msg.value` which could result malicious voters stealing native assets (which belong to other voters which aren't careful).

## Vulnerability Detail
The votes processed by `QuadraticFundingVotingStrategyImplementation.sol` are encoded list of votes (each has a token used for the vote, the amount, grant receiver address and project ID) of arbitrary length. The function `vote` is only called from the corresponding function `vote` in the round implementation (which also passes the original `msg.value`):

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Gitcoin/blob/main/contracts/contracts/round/RoundImplementation.sol#L438
```solidity
votingStrategy.vote{value: msg.value}(encodedVotes, msg.sender);
```

Voting using native tokens is performed as follows (this code snippet is inside a loop indexed by `i`):

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Gitcoin/blob/main/contracts/contracts/votingStrategy/QuadraticFundingStrategy/QuadraticFundingVotingStrategyImplementation.sol#L61-L77
```solidity
    (
      address _token,
      uint256 _amount,
      address _grantAddress,
      bytes32 _projectId
    ) = abi.decode(encodedVotes[i], (
      address,
      uint256,
      address,
      bytes32
    ));

    if (_token == address(0)) {
      /// @dev native token transfer to grant address
      // slither-disable-next-line reentrancy-events
      AddressUpgradeable.sendValue(payable(_grantAddress), _amount);
    }
```

The voter controls both `_grantAddress` and `_amount` as they are part of the encoded vote. There is no check that the sum of `_amount` over all encoded votes matches `msg.value`. This can result in victim users sending more native tokens to the contract than they actually use to vote and malicious users exploiting native tokens left in the contract to send those tokens to their own address, i.e. it is possible to have `msg.value` be zero, `_grantAddress` be the attacker address and `_amount` be the leftover tokens in the contract.

## Impact
A malicious voter can take advantage of other voters and steal some of their native tokens.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The contract references [this implementation of bulk transfers](https://github.com/gitcoinco/BulkTransactions/blob/master/contracts/BulkCheckout.sol) as inspiration. I would advise to add a check for the total amount of native tokens similar to the one used in the original contract.

Additionally, general sanity and validity check for `encodedVotes` are missing:
- Why not allow only the use of the round token instead of an arbitrary token encoded in each vote?
- Why not check that the project ID (and grant address) corresponds to a project which actually applied to the round?

Some of those checks are better placed in the `vote` function in `RoundImplementation.sol` but the lack of input validation for the encoded votes is quite dangerous.
