# There is no checks on the initAddress & _initMetaPtr & alloSettings in constructor for RoundImplementation

## Summary
There is no checks on the initAddress & _initMetaPtr & alloSettings in constructor for RoundImplementation

## Vulnerability Detail
While there is checking on the variable `_initRoundTime` to make sure all the start/end time would be sensible, there is no check on `initAddress.votingStrategy != address(0)`  and `initAddress.payoutStrategy != address(0)`. There is also no checks on `_initMetaPtr` whether the protocolId and pointer is non-zero

## Impact
Careless deployment would lead to unguaranteed contract deployment instead of being reverted for alertness.

## Recommendation
```solidity
require(_initAddress.votingStrategy != address(0));
require(_initAddress.payoutStrategy != address(0));
require(alloSettings != address(0));
require(_initMetaPtr.roundMetaPtr.pointer != bytes32("");
require(_initMetaPtr.roundMetaPtr.protocol != 0);
```
