# Anyone can apply for a round on behalf of a project

## Summary
Anyone can apply for a round on behalf of a project, so an attacker could potentially point to off-chain data that could compromise a project and potentially receive a grant.
## Vulnerability Detail
There are no restrictions on who can apply for a round on behalf of a project.
```solidity
  function applyToRound(bytes32 projectID, MetaPtr calldata newApplicationMetaPtr) external {
    // slither-disable-next-line timestamp
    require(
      applicationsStartTime <= block.timestamp  &&
      block.timestamp <= applicationsEndTime,
      "Round: Applications period not started or over"
    );
    applications.push(Application(projectID, nextApplicationIndex, newApplicationMetaPtr));
    applicationsIndexesByProjectID[projectID].push(nextApplicationIndex);
    emit NewProjectApplication(projectID, nextApplicationIndex, newApplicationMetaPtr);
    nextApplicationIndex++;
  }
```

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Inject project registry to round implementation and create function inside it isOwner so you can check owners.
```diff
    function applyToRound(bytes32 projectID, MetaPtr calldata newApplicationMetaPtr) external {
    // slither-disable-next-line timestamp
    require(
      applicationsStartTime <= block.timestamp  &&
      block.timestamp <= applicationsEndTime,
      "Round: Applications period not started or over"
    );
+    require(projectRegistry.isOwner(projectID, msg.sender),"not an owner");
    applications.push(Application(projectID, nextApplicationIndex, newApplicationMetaPtr));
    applicationsIndexesByProjectID[projectID].push(nextApplicationIndex);
    emit NewProjectApplication(projectID, nextApplicationIndex, newApplicationMetaPtr);
    nextApplicationIndex++;
  }
```
