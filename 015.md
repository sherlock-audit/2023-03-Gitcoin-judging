# Owner list accounting does not work as intended

## Summary
Owner list accounting does not work as supposed to the documentation

## Vulnerability Detail
The documentation states that the 'OwnerList.list` mapping should work like this 
```solidity
  //         OWNERS_LIST_SENTINEL => owner1Address,
    //         owner1Address => owner2Address,
    //         owner2Address => owner3Address,
    //         owner3Address => OWNERS_LIST_SENTINEL
```
Instead it works like this 
```solidity
{
    //         OWNERS_LIST_SENTINEL => owner3Address,
    //         owner1Address => OWNERS_LIST_SENTINEL,
    //         owner2Address => owner1Address,
    //         owner3Address => owner2Address
    //     }
```
With other words, instead of every address being linked to the next one (e.g. `list[address2] == address3`) it is linked to the previous one (e.g. `list[address2] == address1`)

## Impact
Confusion and unexpected behaviour to both the devs and the users
