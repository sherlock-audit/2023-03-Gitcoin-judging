# [M]- create() in ProgramFactory.sol does not check if programContract is a 0 address

## Summary

By default, the `programContract` variable is a zero address, this can cause issues when create is called before the `updateProgramContract()` function.

In the test file, the dev has made this mistake of calling the `create()` before `updateProgramContract()`.

Address(0) checks are normally not considered, but in this case, i believe it should be.

Also the roundFactory.sol already has a check for address(0) but the same was not done for ProgramFactory.sol
This same problem is there for MerklePayoutStrategyFactory.sol and QuadraticFundingVotingStrategyFactory.sol

## Vulnerability Detail

Here'a test to show that the create was called with programContract as address(0)
```solidity
it("create does not check if programContract is a 0 address", async () => {

        expect(await programFactory.programContract()).to.be.equal(ethers.constants.AddressZero);
        const params = [
          { protocol: 1, pointer: "bafybeif43xtcb7zfd6lx7rfq42wjvpkbqgoo7qxrczbj4j4iwfl5aaqv2q" }, // _metaPtr
          [ Wallet.createRandom().address ], // _adminRoles
          [ Wallet.createRandom().address, Wallet.createRandom().address ] // _programOperators
        ];

        const txn = await programFactory.create(
          encodeProgramParameters(params),
        );

        const receipt = await txn.wait();

        expect(txn.hash).to.not.be.empty;
        expect(receipt.status).equals(1);
        expect(await programFactory.programContract()).to.be.equal(ethers.constants.AddressZero);
        
      })
```

## Impact

User will deploy the wrong contract as the implementation address is 0.
they will need to redeploy it again after the implementation address is set.

## Tool used

Manual review, Hardhat

## Recommendation
During initialization of the factory contracts, set the address of those implementation contracts.
