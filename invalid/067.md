# Grant beneficiaries can't withdraw from the Merkle payout strategy.

## Summary
All the payout methods in the MerklePayoutStrategyImplementation require the roundOperator role, hence they do not allow the beneficiaries of the payments to withdraw - which is the only possible reason to employ the Merkle payment distribution.
## Vulnerability Detail
The reason why Merkle token distribution is employed, in general, is to create the contract cheaply - without the need to spend a lot of gas on making a list of the beneficiaries or looping over them to pay them. The contract would then allow the beneficiaries to each withdraw the money and pay the gas.
There is zero reason why the distribution would be permissioned and requiring the admin to do it and pay for the gas. Much less so when it is the same admin (roundOperator) which configures the merkle payout strategy since the operator could just send out the payments directly, retaining exactly the same level of safety.

Therefore, not allowing the beneficiaries to withdraw their money can only be an error.
## Impact
The contract does not serve any practical purpose.

## Recommendation
Either fix the contract to allow the beneficiaries to withdraw the money - as it was meant to be used, or do not use the contract at all.
