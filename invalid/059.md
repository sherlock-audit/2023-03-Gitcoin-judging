# Nothing in this project makes sense and it is useless.

## Summary
The project only pretends to add safety to its operations by employing smart contracts. But these contracts bring zero additional safety (or any other value) compared to all the actors only sending money or tokens (votes) to the wallets of Gitcoin or the grantees since Gitcoin admins do 100% of what matters manually anyway.

Therefore I claim that the whole codebase and its architecture is one big bug.

## Vulnerability Detail
To illustrate why it is so. 

- There is a registry of projects that keeps, in a fancy way, track of the projects and their admins. It is not used anywhere.
- There is a "round" that accepts applications to keep track of the applied projects, that are supposed to be in the registry. Since there is no connection, apparently some admin looks into the registry and manually approves the projects in the round. In the round the status of the projects is not used for anything.
- Votes are cast in the round by a "quadratic strategy" which actually only forwards some tokens or eth to the projects and does nothing useful at all - except maybe throwing events, which are also useless.
- Money need to somehow get into the round. Then it is manually moved into the payout contract by the admin. The admin also configures the payout contract to set how the money should be distributed - apparently based on a manual calculation somehow based on the votes "cast".
- Then the admin, manually, distributes the money from the payment contract.

So as I said - the contracts have no connections between them and serve zero purpose other than to mislead the customers into believe it is safe. Sherlock should not put its name under this.
## Impact
The codebase is useless.
## Code Snippet
ignore this, its just to pass auto check.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1) Hire someone who has some idea of what is going on (judging by the architecture and also wrong usage of OOP that is not currently the case).
2) Rewrite the contracts so that they are connected on the blockchain level and serve some practical purpose and bringing value.
or 
Don't use smart contracts at all.
