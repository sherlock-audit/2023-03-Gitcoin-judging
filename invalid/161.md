# Cannot update single time with updateStartAndEndTimes

## Summary

It has hard or impossible (depending on time conditions) for round operator to update the timestamps constraining the end / start of the different round periods using the `updateStartAndEndTimes()` function.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function to update the timestamps constraining the end / start of the different round period forces to provide four valid time inputs and checks for validity in the same way it does for the `initialize()` function. Notably it enforces `block.timestamp <= newApplicationsStartTime`.

This means that for example a round operator that wants to extend the round duration by providing a later `newRoundEndTime` will need to provide a valid `newApplicationsStartTime` that is in the future (or now). Same goes for `newApplicationsEndTime`.

## Impact

If round operator wants to update `newRoundEndTime` to extend round voting duration while currently in the "Selection" phase (`applicationsEndTime < now < roundStartTime), they will need to extend the "Application" phase by providing a valid `applicationsEndTime` in the future.

I refer to the round phases as defined in [the documentation](https://docs.allo.gitcoin.co/core-concepts/round).

I give a single valid example of impossible update (without having to resolve constraints), there are multiple that will all be fixed at the same time by writing independent time updating functions.
