# function can block user from sending native tokens.

## Summary
In RoundImplementation.sol contract, if someone calls vote() function with token address and native token, native tokens will not be sent to grantAddress and stuck in QuadraticFundingVotingStrategyImplementation.sol contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
vote() function that user calls will call votingStrategy.vote function and this has a parameter to check if user filled token address, send token and if token address is zero, send native token. Problem is if the user sends both, the native tokens don't send to grantAddress and transferred to QuadraticFundingVotingStrategyImplementation.sol contract.

Just look at this function and imagin user call this with native token (that's payable) and with token address in same time.
```solidity
function vote(bytes[] memory encodedVotes) external payable {
    // slither-disable-next-line timestamp
    require(
      roundStartTime <= block.timestamp &&
      block.timestamp <= roundEndTime,
      "Round: Round is not active"
    );

    votingStrategy.vote{value: msg.value}(encodedVotes, msg.sender);
  }
```

Function that user call will call this function:

```solidity
function vote(bytes[] calldata encodedVotes, address voterAddress) external override payable nonReentrant isRoundContract {

    /// @dev iterate over multiple donations and transfer funds
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < encodedVotes.length; i++) {

      /// @dev decode encoded vote
      (
        address _token,
        uint256 _amount,
        address _grantAddress,
        bytes32 _projectId
      ) = abi.decode(encodedVotes[i], (
        address,
        uint256,
        address,
        bytes32
      ));

      if (_token == address(0)) {
        /// @dev native token transfer to grant address
        // slither-disable-next-line reentrancy-events
        AddressUpgradeable.sendValue(payable(_grantAddress), _amount);
      } else {

        /// @dev erc20 transfer to grant address
        // slither-disable-next-line arbitrary-send-erc20,reentrancy-events,
        SafeERC20Upgradeable.safeTransferFrom(
          IERC20Upgradeable(_token),
          voterAddress,
          _grantAddress,
          _amount
        );

      }
```
In this scenario function will continue with else and transfer tokens to grantAddress but the native tokens will be stuck in QuadraticFundingVotingStrategyImplementation.sol contract.


## Impact
Potentially users funds will not send to grant address and will not count also can lose native token funds in contract.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
function vote(bytes[] calldata encodedVotes, address voterAddress) external override payable nonReentrant isRoundContract {

    /// @dev iterate over multiple donations and transfer funds
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < encodedVotes.length; i++) {

      /// @dev decode encoded vote
      (
        address _token,
        uint256 _amount,
        address _grantAddress,
        bytes32 _projectId
      ) = abi.decode(encodedVotes[i], (
        address,
        uint256,
        address,
        bytes32
      ));

      if (_token == address(0)) {
        /// @dev native token transfer to grant address
        // slither-disable-next-line reentrancy-events
        AddressUpgradeable.sendValue(payable(_grantAddress), _amount);
      } else {

        /// @dev erc20 transfer to grant address
        // slither-disable-next-line arbitrary-send-erc20,reentrancy-events,
        SafeERC20Upgradeable.safeTransferFrom(
          IERC20Upgradeable(_token),
          voterAddress,
          _grantAddress,
          _amount
        );

      }

      /// @dev emit event for transfer
      emit Voted(
        _token,
        _amount,
        voterAddress,
        _grantAddress,
        _projectId,
        msg.sender
      );

    }

  }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider logic in else to check user msg.sender should be zero or implement another logic to prevent this issue.
