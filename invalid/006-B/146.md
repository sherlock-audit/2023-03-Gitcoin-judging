# Vote function should only allow voting for approved application project

## Summary
There are 4 statuses for a project: Pending, Approved, Rejected and Canceled. However,
the `vote` function in `RoundImplementation` contract does not check if the project being voted is in Approved state.
This lead to project Pending (not reviewed to approved) or even Rejected and Canceled could be voted on and donations funds are lost to rejected/pending/canceled projects since these projects will be removed from payout process.

## Vulnerability Detail
Current function vote does not account for project status:
```solidity
function vote(bytes[] memory encodedVotes) external payable {
    // slither-disable-next-line timestamp
    require(
      roundStartTime <= block.timestamp &&
      block.timestamp <= roundEndTime,
      "Round: Round is not active"
    );

    votingStrategy.vote{value: msg.value}(encodedVotes, msg.sender);
  }
```

## Impact
- Pending, Rejected and Canceled project could still be voted on
- Donations lost to pending/rejected/canceled projects
