# The voter can vote without paying a token by having control of the grant address variable

## Summary
The voter can control the grant address while submitting the vote, meaning that the voter can pass their address as the grant address and then receive the vote token after submitting votes. As a result, the voter only pays for the gas of the transaction to boost their vote score.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `QuadraticFundingVotingStrategyImplementation` contract, the `vote()` function allows the user to vote any project via the `vote()` function in the `RoundImplementation` contract.

However, the voter can control the grant address variable that defines the recipient address of the vote. This allows the voter to vote without actually paying a token by passing their address as the grant address, and then the token will be sent back to their address after voting.

## Impact
The projectâ€™s vote score can be manipulated by the voter without paying a token.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
We recommend implementing the state variable to store the grant address for voting, and it should be set by the round's operator before the voting phase begins.
