# The voter can submit their votes by using any token

## Summary
The `vote()` function in the `QuadraticFundingVotingStrategyImplementation` contract does not properly check the token that the voter is using for voting. As a result, the user can vote with any token they have to boost the project's vote score.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `RoundImplementation` contract, the `vote()` function allows the voter to send their vote to any project by executing the `vote()` function in the `RoundImplementation` contract.

However, the token that is used for voting is not properly checked, which means the user can use any token to vote, e.g., use a priceless token to boost the vote score which will affect the funding that the project will receive later.

## Impact
The projectâ€™s vote score can be manipulated by using priceless token.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
We recommend implementing a condition to allow only the desired token to be used for voting, as shown in the example below.

```diff
function vote(bytes[] calldata encodedVotes, address voterAddress) external override payable nonReentrant isRoundContract {

  /// @dev iterate over multiple donations and transfer funds
  for (uint256 i = 0; i < encodedVotes.length; i++) {

    /// @dev decode encoded vote
    (
      address _token,
      uint256 _amount,
      address _grantAddress,
      bytes32 _projectId
    ) = abi.decode(encodedVotes[i], (
      address,
      uint256,
      address,
      bytes32
    ));
    
+   //********* validate the `_token` variables *********//
+    require(_token == RoundImplementation(msg.sender).token(), "Invalid token");

```
