# The voter may vote the project that was rejected

## Summary
The `vote()` function in the `QuadraticFundingVotingStrategyImplementation` contract does not properly validate the `_projectId` that a voter uses to cast their vote. Consequently, a user can vote for any project, even if it has been rejected.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `QuadraticFundingVotingStrategyImplementation` contract, the `vote()` function allows the user to vote any project via the `vote()` function in the `RoundImplementation` contract.

However, the voter can control the `_projectId` variable that determines which project to vote for. This means they may accidentally vote for a project that was rejected and transfer tokens to an undeserving address, resulting in an unintended loss of funds.

## Impact
The voter may accidentally vote for a project that was rejected.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
We recommend implementing a condition to allow only the accepted project can be used for voting, as shown in the example below.

```diff
function vote(bytes[] calldata encodedVotes, address voterAddress) external override payable nonReentrant isRoundContract {

  /// @dev iterate over multiple donations and transfer funds
  for (uint256 i = 0; i < encodedVotes.length; i++) {

    /// @dev decode encoded vote
    (
      address _token,
      uint256 _amount,
      address _grantAddress,
      bytes32 _projectId
    ) = abi.decode(encodedVotes[i], (
      address,
      uint256,
      address,
      bytes32
    ));
    
    
+    uint256[] projectIndexes = RoundImplementation(msg.sender).getApplicationIndexesByProjectID(_projectId);
+    uint256 projectStatus;
+    for (uint j = 0; j < projectIndexes.length; j++) {
+      projectStatus = RoundImplementation(msg.sender).getApplicationStatus(projectIndexes[j]);
+      if(projectStatus == 1){
+        break;
+      }
+    }
+    require(projectStatus == 1, "Project is not accepted");
```
