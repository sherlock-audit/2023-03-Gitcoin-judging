# Users are not able to get ownership of newly created projects

## Summary

Users are not able to get ownership of newly created projects or add another user as a project owner.

## Vulnerability Detail

There is a problem in setting up a new owner in initProjectOwners() functions. Because of it the project will be created but no user set as its admin. 

I had to add one more function to test `uint256 count`:

`    
function getOwnerCount (uint256 projectID) external view returns (uint256) {
    OwnerList storage owners = projectsOwners[projectID];
     return owners.count;
}
`

Here is a test with foundry:

`
pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

import "forge-std/Test.sol";
import "../contracts/ProjectRegistry/ProjectRegistry.sol"; 
import "forge-std/console2.sol";

contract ProjectRegistryTest is Test {
    ProjectRegistry public projectRegistry;

    address admin = vm.addr(23432432);

    address REGULAR_USER_1 = vm.addr(23432324432);
    address REGULAR_USER_2 = vm.addr(23432432);

    function testCreateP() public {
        projectRegistry = new ProjectRegistry();
        MetaPtr memory data = MetaPtr(1, 'sdlfhsdbdbfbdsfbdsjbdlbf');
       
        vm.startPrank(REGULAR_USER_2);
            projectRegistry.createProject(data);
        vm.stopPrank();

        console.log("Project id ", projectRegistry.projectsCount()); // 1

        address[] memory owners = projectRegistry.getProjectOwners(1);
        for(uint i = 0; i<owners.length; i++) {
            console.log("Project owner is ", owners[i]);
        }

        console.log("Project owners", projectRegistry.getOwnerCount(1)); //0

        /* unable to make test due to modifier and no owner set
        vm.startPrank(REGULAR_USER_2);
            projectRegistry.addProjectOwner(1, REGULAR_USER_1);
        vm.stopPrank();
        */
    }
} 
`

If you upload projectRegistry.sol in Remix it will also fail in setting up an owner for a new project. 

## Impact

Users will not be able to get an ownership on their projects or manage other users to be its admins.

## Tool used

Manual Review, Foundry

## Recommendation

Try to use a different struct and mapping to manage users, for example:
instead of using `mapping(address => address) list` you can use `mappig(uint256 =>(mapping address=>address) owners`, like `projectID=>mainOwner=>otherOwners`. It will be easier to manage owners.
