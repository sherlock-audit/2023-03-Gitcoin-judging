# Possible DOS

## Summary
in MerkelPayoutStrategyimplementation there is a payout function that implements a for loop to distribute funds which could lead to a dos attack
## Vulnerability Detail
when interacting with payout in MerkelPayoutStrategyimplementation there is a for loop which calls _distribute and sends funds.if any of the distributions has wrong data and causes a revert the whole thing would have to be restarted again
## Impact
could lead to denial of service and would have to execute the function all over again

Manual Review

## Recommendation
use try catch 

function payout(Distribution[] calldata _distributions) external virtual payable isRoundOperator {//@audit
    require(isReadyForPayout == true, "Payout: Not ready for payout");

    for (uint256 i = 0; i < _distributions.length; ++i) {
        try _distribute(_distributions[i]) {
            // Handle success case if needed
        } catch {
            // Handle error case if needed
        }
    }

    emit BatchPayoutSuccessful(msg.sender);
}
