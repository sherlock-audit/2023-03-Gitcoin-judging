# Programs can avoid protocol fee

## Summary

Programs that distribute funds through a round can avoid the protocol fees by misusing / avoiding completely the `setReadyForPayout` function.

## Vulnerability Detail

The goal of the function `setReadyForPayout` is to collect protocol fees and call `payoutStrategy.setReadyForPayout()`:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Gitcoin/blob/main/contracts/contracts/payoutStrategy/IPayoutStrategy.sol#L120-L124

You can see that the `setReadyForPayout` can only be called when the round has ended and by the round contract. However, since the payout contract is selected by the program deploying the round and the gitcoin protocol team encourages programs to create their own contracts, they can use a custom payout contract with a function `setReadyForPayoutWithoutFees` that can be called by anyone when the round is over.

This new function can withdraw the funds from the round contract (if given ROUND_OPERATOR_ROLE by an admin) or the round operators can directly transfer the funds independently to the payout contract.

## Impact

The program distributing funds through rounds can avoid paying the protocol fee.

## Recommendation

Enforce tokens to be deposited before round starts / at deployment and apply the fee then.
