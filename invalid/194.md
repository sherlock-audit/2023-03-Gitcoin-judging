# Naming convention for setReadyForPayout() function in RoundImplementation.sol is very confusing

## Summary
Naming convention for setReadyForPayout() function in `RoundImplementation.sol` is very confusing. 
## Vulnerability Detail
The function comment says this ->   `/// @notice Pay Protocol & Round Fees and transfer funds to payout contract (only by ROUND_OPERATOR_ROLE)`

But the function name is setReadyForPayout, which also includes a lot of operations like `Pay Protocol & Round Fees` and `transfer funds`. Also this function emits `PayFeeAndEscrowFundsToPayoutContract` event which is completely different to the function name.

Also, in line [#474](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Gitcoin/blob/main/contracts/contracts/round/RoundImplementation.sol#L474) you can see the function call `payoutStrategy.setReadyForPayout();` is same as the current function name, which is also very confusing for the developer to read the code.


## Impact
Poor code readbility for this function as it is doing few more important operations rather than just setting ready for payout flag.

## Recommendation
Please update the function name to a better name, or move the `Pay Protocol & Round Fees and transfer funds to payout contract` operations to a different function
