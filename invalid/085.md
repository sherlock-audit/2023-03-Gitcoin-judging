# The owner of the `ProjectRegistr` contract may delete all other owners

## Summary

The identity design of the `ProjectRegistr` contract is unreasonable, an owner can delete all other owners.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
    function removeProjectOwner(uint256 projectID, address prevOwner, address owner) external onlyProjectOwner(projectID) {
        require(owner != address(0) && owner != OWNERS_LIST_SENTINEL, "PR001");

        OwnerList storage owners = projectsOwners[projectID];

        require(owners.list[prevOwner] == owner, "PR003");
        require(owners.count > 1, "PR004");

        owners.list[prevOwner] = owners.list[owner];
        delete owners.list[owner];
        owners.count--;

        emit OwnerRemoved(projectID, owner);
    }
```

The owner of `ProjectRegistr` can delete all other owners, including the creator of the Project, through the `removeProjectOwner` function.

## Impact

It may cause malicious owners to take the Project as their own.
