# Allowing to change a round details can result in unfair distribution of funds

## Summary

The `RoundImplementation` contract presents different privileged functions which can be called after a round has started. This could result in unfair rounds due to the ability to change the round fees, which projects are accepted, or end time if the round is not going according to the operator bias. To expand on this, the list of projects for which to vote/contribute to should be final before users are able to vote/contribute, as well as the round details.

It should be noted that while operators are intended to be trusted parties, a quadratic funding protocol should be as immutable as possible to prevent any bias towards projects, or misallocation of funds by contributors which voted for a project that was then removed. The remediation provided in this issue provide simple to implement fixes that would make the protocol more fair and immutable. 

## Vulnerability Detail

Quadratic funding should be a democratic process and thus should be as unbiased and immutable as possible. The current implementation provides great privileges to the operators. The following functions can be called after a round has started, and possibly after contributors already voted and contributed a sum of money towards their project. 

The functions are presented below:

* `setApplicationStatuses` - This function allows to change an application status during the voting period. Users might have already voted for a project that was previously accepted, which then gets their application cancelled. 
* `updateRoundFeePercentage` - This function allows to change the round fees. This does not enforce any range (which could also lead to incorrect calculations or reverts) and could be set to 100% preventing any funds from being distributed to the projects.
* `updateStartAndEndTimes` - This function can be called after a round has already started and could be used by malicious operators to continue a round until more favourable conditions for certain projects are met. For instance, projects could bribe the operators to add more time to a round.

## Impact

Payouts could be influenced and more deserving projects could not receive what they were due. Furthermore, the pre-condition for which contributors decided to vote/contribute would have changed, such as the fees, or the project for which they voted for had their application status changed.

## Code Snippet

Contract `RoundImplementation`: 

* change [applications status](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Gitcoin/blob/main/contracts/contracts/round/RoundImplementation.sol#L398)
* change [end time](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Gitcoin/blob/main/contracts/contracts/round/RoundImplementation.sol#L358-L363)
* change [fees](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Gitcoin/blob/main/contracts/contracts/round/RoundImplementation.sol#L289)

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended that the `updateRoundFeePercentage` setter function implements a modifier such as the one below:

```js
modifier roundHasNotStarted() {
    // slither-disable-next-line timestamp
    require(roundStartTime < block.timestamp, "Round: Round has started");
    _;
}
```

For the `updateStartAndEndTimes` - it is recommended to add a check that the round has not started already before updating this value.

For the `setApplicationStatuses` function - Is is recommended that application statuses are only changed during a separate phase which should be between the application and the voting phase. This would require extra state variables and a modifier to enforce the function to be only called during this phase.
