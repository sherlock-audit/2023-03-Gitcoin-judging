# Reentrancy MerklePayoutStrategyFactory.sol in create function

## Summary
Read of persistent state following external call. The contract account state is accessed after an external call. To prevent reentrancy issues, consider accessing the state only before the call, especially if the callee is untrusted. Alternatively, a reentrancy lock can be used to prevent untrusted callees from re-entering the contract in an intermediate state.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
MerklePayoutStrategyFactory.create();
```
## Impact
The contract account state is accessed after an external call. So, more money can be withdrawn than deposited.
