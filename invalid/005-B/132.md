# Voter ETH funds are stuck if sent ETH is more than sum of ETH amounts of all votes

## Summary
Whenever a voter sends ETH to vote and sends more than the exact ETH amount that matches the sum of ETH amounts of all submitted votes, the remaining ETH gets stuck in the voting strategy. The voting strategy (QuadraticFundingVotingStrategyImplementation.sol) does not have a function the user could withdraw the excess ETH with.

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Voter calls the "vote" function in RoundImplementation.sol and submits 3 ETH and 2 votes (each 1 ETH)

3.  RoundImplementation.sol calls the "vote" function in the voting strategy (QuadraticFundingVotingStrategyImplementation.sol) and forwards all 3 ETH sent by user.

5. QuadraticFundingVotingStrategyImplementation.sol iterates over all votes and distributes the sent ETH to the grantees (_grantAddress) according to the associated ETH amounts (_amount). In this example 2x 1 ETH would be distributed.

7. Balance of QuadraticFundingVotingStrategyImplementation.sol now has the remaining ETH in its balance (3 ETH - 2x 1 ETH = 1 ETH).

## Impact
This is ETH funds lost for the user. They are trapped in the protocol. E.g. a simple typo could lead to a way larger amount being sent than the user wanted. There is no way the user could recover this ETH as there is no "withdrawEth" function. And the user interacted with one contract which forwarded the ETH to another contract. So even looking into the contract that got interacted with would not show the remaining ETH balance. The user would need to be more sophisticated and look in-chain where the ETH went.

## Recommendation

Consider either returning all the remaining ETH to the user directly after voting was processed or creating a function that allows the user to collect the remaining ETH after voting. Take into account that sending ETH with a push method may trigger the fallback function on the callerâ€™s address (danger of reentrancy). Alternatively the transaction could also be directly rejected in the vote function of RoundImplementation.sol by checking if the sent ETH exactly matches the sum of ETH of all sent votes.
