# User could lost his funds.

## Summary
Contract dont check msg.value and sum of amount. 
## Vulnerability Detail
User can call vote() and send 1 ether(mistakenly more, then sum of all amounts), but sum of amount(encoded in encodedVotes) for all projects could be less, remaining part of ether will be locked on contract balance. 
## Impact
User lost his funds

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
After for loop, check that msg.value ==  sum of amounts
```solidity
function vote(bytes[] calldata encodedVotes, address voterAddress) external override payable nonReentrant isRoundContract {

    /// @dev iterate over multiple donations and transfer funds
   uint totalAmount;  // <- new var
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < encodedVotes.length; i++) {
       
      /// @dev decode encoded vote
      (
        address _token,
        uint256 _amount,
        address _grantAddress,
        bytes32 _projectId
      ) = abi.decode(encodedVotes[i], (
        address,
        uint256,
        address,
        bytes32
      ));
     totalAmount += _amount;  // <- add amount
     ...
  } // for end
  require(totalAmount == msg.value); // <- check

```
