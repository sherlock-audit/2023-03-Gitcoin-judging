# Excess fund could be locked in VotingStrategy contract

## Summary

The `msg.value` or `_token` are not verified in function `vote()` in the VotingStrategy. In case there is some left over of mistakenly sent eth/erc20 in the voting contract, these fund could be locked.


## Vulnerability Detail

`msg.value` is not checked, and the `encodedVotes` array can contain multiple votes at the same time, mistakes could happen and result in left over eth. 

The decoded `_token` is not verified neither. If the provided `_token` is different from the right token specified in the round contract, the voter could send the wrong token, and stuck in the contract. 

And there is no way to retrieve the mistakenly sent fund in the 
VotingStrategy contract, those fund could be locked.

## Impact

If there is some left over or mistakenly sent eth or erc20 in the contract, the excess fund could be locked in the contract. 

## Code Snippet
