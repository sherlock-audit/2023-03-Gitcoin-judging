# At Vote, ETH gets stuck depending on the address specified and the amount of ETH.

## Summary
When Vote, the address specified is ERC20, however, if ETH is transferred by mistake, ETH will be stuck in the contract.Also, there is no check for `_amount` and `msg.value`, so it gets stuck if it was sent over.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `vote(bytes[] memory encodedVotes)` called from `RoundImplementation `is a payable function. `votingStrategy.vote{value: msg.value}(encodedVotes, msg. sender)` calls `vote(bytes[] calldata encodedVotes, address voterAddress)` in `QuadrateFundingVotingStrategyImplementation`.
If `_token` is specified in ERC20, `safeTransferFrom` is invoked, but if ETH was sent together, `VotingStrategyImplementation` has no function to pull out ETH, so it is trapped.
Also, there is no check for `_amount` and `msg.value`, so it gets stuck if it was sent over.
## Impact
Extra ETH that does not match the total amount gets stuck in more and more contracts.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check the amount of ETH sent  and individual values of the arguments; add a function to withdraw ETH.
