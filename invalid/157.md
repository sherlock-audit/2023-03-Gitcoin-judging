# setApplicationStatuses does not check for selection period

## Summary

[The documentation](https://docs.allo.gitcoin.co/core-concepts/round) defines periods in this order: application, selection, voting, payout. Reading from the documentation and communication from the protocol team, it appears that the selection period is used to review application of participants and accept / deny them participation in the round.

However, the function `setApplicationStatuses()` used to accept / deny application can be called at any point as long as the round has not ended.

## Vulnerability Detail

`setApplicationStatuses()` can be called by round operator during the voting and application phases while it should only be callable during the "Selection" phase.

## Impact

Participants in the round / voters have little guarantee as to which applications are accepted / denied while interacting with the contracts during the voting phase. It could be that an application is at first accepted by the round operator, and later rejected towards the end of the voting period, throwing off / manipulating the voting results.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Only allow `setApplicationStatuses()` to be called before round start.
