# The definition of modifier for roundHasEnded differs from file to file.

## Summary
Two modifiers of the same name that control the end of a round are defined in two places, but with different definitions.
## Vulnerability Detail
`IPayoutStrategy` defines `block.timestamp >= roundEndTime`, while `RoundImplementation` defines `block.timestamp > roundEndTime`.` block.timestamp == roundEndTime`, `IPayoutStrategy` can call `setReadyForPayout()`, which should be invoked after the end of the round, while `RoundImplementation` can do `vote()`, an action during the round.
Also, `IPayoutStrategy` is an abstract contract and may be inherited and extended in the future. When it does, it may cause more significant problems.
## Impact
Critical controls are not available as intended.

## Recommendation
Unify the definition of modifier; it should be in one place.
