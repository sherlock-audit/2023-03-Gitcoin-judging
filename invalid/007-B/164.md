# Modifier discrepency and broken logic will lead to unwanted protocol behaviour

## Summary
Modifier discrepancy and broken logic will lead to unwanted protocol behaviour

## Vulnerability Detail
In IPayoutStrategy the roundHasEnded modifier is implemented the following way:

``IPayoutStrategy.sol:``

**    /// @notice modifier to check if round has ended.
    modifier roundHasEnded() {
        uint roundEndTime = RoundImplementation(roundAddress).roundEndTime();
        require(block.timestamp >= roundEndTime, "round has not ended");
        _;
    }
**

And thats the correct way roundHasEnded modifier should be because when block.timestamp == roundEndTime, round should count as ended, but in RoundImplementation, there are again 2 modifiers. One to check if the round has started and the other, if the round has ended.

``RoundImplementation.sol:``
**
    /// @notice modifier to check if round has not ended.
    modifier roundHasNotEnded() {
        // slither-disable-next-line timestamp
        require(block.timestamp <= roundEndTime, "Round: Round has ended");
        _;
    }
**

**
   /// @notice modifier to check if round has not ended.
    modifier roundHasEnded() {
        // slither-disable-next-line timestamp
        require(block.timestamp > roundEndTime, "Round: Round has not ended");
        _;
    }
**

The logic for both of the modifiers is broken and also there is a discrepancy between the roundHasEnded() modifier in RoundImplementation and IPayoutStrategy.

## Impact
Every function which uses these 2 modifiers is prone to some unwanted behaviour.
All functions with roundHasNotEnded() modifier, can be called even when theoretically (block.timestamp == roundEndTime) the round has already ended, the same goes for roundHasEnded() modifier, all functions using this modifier can be called before the round has actually ended.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Logic should be corrected by the following way:

** /// @notice modifier to check if round has not ended.
    modifier roundHasNotEnded() {
        // slither-disable-next-line timestamp
       ``--`` require(block.timestamp <= roundEndTime, "Round: Round has ended");
       ``++`` require(block.timestamp < roundEndTime, "Round: Round has ended");
        _;
    }
**
--- We can see that with the old logic of the modifier, if the block.timestamp == roundEndTime, it will still count as the round is still active but thats incorrect

**
    /// @notice modifier to check if round has not ended.
    modifier roundHasEnded() {
        // slither-disable-next-line timestamp
        ``--``require(block.timestamp > roundEndTime, "Round: Round has not ended");
        ``++``require(block.timestamp >= roundEndTime, "Round: Round has not ended");
        _;
    }
**
--- Here comes the inconsistent logic between the same roundHasEnded() modifer (In roundImpelemntation and IPayoutStrategy). With the new logic the problem is fixed.
