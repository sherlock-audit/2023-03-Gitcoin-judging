# No check on RoundImplementation.roundFeePercentage to enforce a cap of 100%; payout can be blocked

## Summary
There is no check on `RoundImplementation.roundFeePercentage` to enforce a cap of 100% during its admin update as well as assignment in constructor.

## Vulnerability Detail
newFeePercentage could be set to above 100% technically, which can then block `setReadyForPayout()` since the matched_amount could not be bigger than 100%.

## Impact
since a roundFee would be calculated based on the matchedAmount multiplied by the percentage; a roundFeePercentage exceeding 100% would block the payout since the fundInContract is unlikely to be bigger than the sum of the needed fund.

## Recommendation
```diff
  function updateRoundFeePercentage(uint32 newFeePercentage) external roundHasNotEnded onlyRole(ROUND_OPERATOR_ROLE) {
+   require(newFeePercentage <= alloSettings.DENOMINATOR());
    roundFeePercentage = newFeePercentage;
    emit RoundFeePercentageUpdated(roundFeePercentage);
  }
```
```diff
constructor {
+   require(newFeePercentage <= alloSettings.DENOMINATOR());
}
