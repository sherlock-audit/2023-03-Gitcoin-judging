# The storage method of `ProjectRegistry` contract owners is unreasonable

## Summary

The storage method of ProjectRegistry contract owners is unreasonable, and there are two problems in total:

1. The variable name and comment of the `removeProjectOwner` function do not match the logic of the code
2. Every time the owner is deleted, the entire owners list needs to be traversed

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
    function addProjectOwner(uint256 projectID, address newOwner) external onlyProjectOwner(projectID) {
        require(newOwner != address(0) && newOwner != OWNERS_LIST_SENTINEL && newOwner != address(this), "PR001");

        OwnerList storage owners = projectsOwners[projectID];

        require(owners.list[newOwner] == address(0), "PR002");

        owners.list[newOwner] = owners.list[OWNERS_LIST_SENTINEL];
        owners.list[OWNERS_LIST_SENTINEL] = newOwner;
        owners.count++;

        emit OwnerAdded(projectID, newOwner);
    }
```

According to `addProjectOwner` function, the storage method of owners in the `ProjectRegistry` contract is similar to a circular linked list. Each new owner points to the previous owner, and finally points to `address(1)`, and `address(1)` points to the new owner. As shown below.

```text
address(1) <- owner0 <- owner1 <- owner2 <- owner3 <- owner4
  |                                                     ↑
  |                                                     |
  +-----------------------------------------------------+
```

```solidity
    function removeProjectOwner(uint256 projectID, address prevOwner, address owner) external onlyProjectOwner(projectID) {
        require(owner != address(0) && owner != OWNERS_LIST_SENTINEL, "PR001");

        OwnerList storage owners = projectsOwners[projectID];

[1]->   require(owners.list[prevOwner] == owner, "PR003");
        require(owners.count > 1, "PR004");

        owners.list[prevOwner] = owners.list[owner];
        delete owners.list[owner];
        owners.count--;

        emit OwnerRemoved(projectID, owner);
    }
```

The `removeProjectOwner` function has `prevOwner` and `owner` as input parameters. This is obviously problematic. For example, according to the above figure, when `owner2` is to be deleted, if `owner1` is passed in, code 1 will have a verification error (`owners.list[owner1]` is `owner0`, not `owner2`). The correct parameter is the `nextOwner`.

This will cause if the user follows the documentation to call `removeProjectOwner`, it will always fail.

```js
  it("emits AddedOwner and RemovedOwner when OwnerList is modified", async function () {
    const projectID = 0;
    const addTx = await this.contract.connect(this.owner).addProjectOwner(projectID, this.accounts[1].address);

    const { events: addEvents } = await addTx.wait();
    const [emittedProject0, addedOwner] = addEvents[0].args;

    expect(emittedProject0).to.equal(projectID);
    expect(addedOwner).to.equal(this.accounts[1].address);
    expect(addEvents[0].event).to.equal("OwnerAdded");

→   const removeTx = await this.contract.connect(this.owner).removeProjectOwner(projectID, OWNERS_LIST_SENTINEL, this.accounts[1].address);

    const { events } = await removeTx.wait();
    const [emittedProject1, removedOwner] = events[0].args;
    expect(emittedProject1).to.equal(projectID);
    expect(removedOwner).to.equal(this.accounts[1].address);
    expect(events[0].event).to.equal("OwnerRemoved");
  });
```

The test code can prove this, the previous owner of `this.accounts[1].address` should be `this.owner`, not `OWNERS_LIST_SENTINEL`.

Then, if you call according to the code logic, there is also a problem. For example, to delete `owner1`, I need to pass in the owner behind `owner1` (`owner2`). However, in order to find the following nodes in the linked list data structure, the linked list needs to be traversed once. This results in the need to traverse the entire `owners` every time an owner is deleted.

## Impact

This will cause if the user follows the documentation to call `removeProjectOwner`, it will always fail.
