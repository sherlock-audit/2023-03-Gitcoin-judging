# Precision loss while fetching the application status

## Summary

Probability of precision loss due to the set order of operations. 

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `getApplicationStatus` function, there is a possibility of precision loss due to the order of operations. While calculating the rowIndex, `applicationIndex / 128` performs integer division, which truncates any fractional part of the result. If applicationIndex is not a multiple of 128, then there will be a fractional part that is truncated.

In the following line of code to calculate the columnIndex, the code follows: `uint256 colIndex = (applicationIndex % 128) * 2;`, which basically performs a division operation before a multiplication operation.

If the truncated fractional part of the division is odd, then the multiplication by 2 will cause a precision loss, as the result will no longer be an integer. This can either lead the operation to return a value of 0, or perform several unintended operations that can be really fatal.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
/// @notice Get application status
  /// @param applicationIndex index of the application
  /// @return status status of the application
  function getApplicationStatus(uint256 applicationIndex) external view returns(uint256) {
    require(applicationIndex < applications.length, "Round: Application does not exist");

    uint256 rowIndex = applicationIndex / 128;
    uint256 colIndex = (applicationIndex % 128) * 2;

    uint256 currentRow = applicationStatusesBitMap[rowIndex];
    uint256 status = (currentRow >> colIndex) & 3;

    return status;
  }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Ensure that the order of the operations are properly set. First multiply applicationIndex by 2 and then perform the division by 128 operation on the column index.
