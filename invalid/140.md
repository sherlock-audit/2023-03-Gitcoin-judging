# Due to lack of access control, any users can freely create a round, which lead to that the bad rounds would be created

## Summary
Due to lack of access control, any users can call the RoundFactory#`create()` and they can freely create a round, which lead to that the bad rounds would be created.

## Vulnerability Detail
Within the RoundFactory#`create()`, 
new Round (RoundImplementation) would be created like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Gitcoin/blob/main/contracts/contracts/round/RoundFactory.sol#L92-L110
```solidity
  /**
   * @notice Clones RoundImplementation a new round and emits event
   *
   * @param encodedParameters Encoded parameters for creating a round
   * @param ownedBy Program which created the contract
   */
  function create(
    bytes calldata encodedParameters,
    address ownedBy
  ) external returns (address) {

    require(roundImplementation != address(0), "roundImplementation is 0x");
    require(alloSettings != address(0), "alloSettings is 0x");

    address clone = ClonesUpgradeable.clone(roundImplementation);

    emit RoundCreated(clone, ownedBy, payable(roundImplementation));

    IRoundImplementation(payable(clone)).initialize(
      encodedParameters,
      alloSettings
    );

    return clone;
  }
```

According to the ["Overview"](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Gitcoin-masaun#overview) in the README, a program operator is supposed to manage a round like this:
> _2. Programs. Each grant-giving organization will have an on-chain program, which manages it's rounds._

However, within the RoundFactory#`create()` above, there is no validation to check wether or not the caller would be a `program operator` who has a Program Operator Role. ðŸ”µ

As a result, any users can call the RoundFactory#`create()` above and they can freely create a round. 

## Impact
If a malicious user can freely create a round, it lead to that the bad rounds would be created.
For example, the bad rounds that might be created includes:
- a malicious ERC20 that is assigned via the `_token` parameter in the RoundImplementation#`initialize()`.
- a strange round fee percentage that is assigned via the `_roundFeePercentage` parameter in the RoundImplementation#`initialize()`.
   etc.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Within the ProgramImplementation#`initialize()`, a Program Operator Role (= `PROGRAM_OPERATOR_ROLE`) would be granted like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Gitcoin/blob/main/contracts/contracts/program/ProgramImplementation.sol#L73

So, consider adding an access control modifier to the RoundFactory#`create()` in order to check wether or not the caller would be a `program operator` who has a Program Operator Role (=`PROGRAM_OPERATOR_ROLE`) like this:
```solidity
  /**
   * @notice Clones RoundImplementation a new round and emits event
   *
   * @param encodedParameters Encoded parameters for creating a round
   * @param ownedBy Program which created the contract
   */
  function create(
    bytes calldata encodedParameters,
    address ownedBy
+ ) external onlyRole(PROGRAM_OPERATOR_ROLE) returns (address) {
- ) external returns (address) {
    ...
```
