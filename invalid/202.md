# Init function in AlloSettings is exposed for a malicious user to call it

## Summary
A malicious user can call the init function in alloSettings and take control of the contract
## Vulnerability Detail
If the AlloSettings contract is deployed without being initialized, anyone can call the initialize() function, including an attacker. An attacker could send a transaction to the initialize() function, which would set the contract's owner to the attacker's address. This would give the attacker full control over the contract and its settings.
## Impact
The impact of this would be that anyone could potentially become the owner of the contract by calling the initialize() function with their own address as the owner. They could then change the protocol treasury address and protocol fee percentage, which could have significant financial implications for the protocol

## Recommendation
Use the below refactoring to mitigate this issue

```solidity
  constructor() initializer {
    __Context_init_unchained();
    __Ownable_init_unchained();
  }
```

```solidity
  modifier onlyInitializer() {
    require(owner() == address(0), "Contract has already been initialized");
    _;
  }
```
