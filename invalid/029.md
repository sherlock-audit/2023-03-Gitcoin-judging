# Round funds dustribution can be stucked forever

## Summary

Round funds dustribution can be stucked forever because of blacklisted users.

## Vulnerability Detail

Some tokens, like USDT, has blacklists. In case of user will get into this list current implementation of payouts can be freezed. 
So the payout() function loop the `address _grantee = _distribution.grantee;` and a grantee can be blocked user. Payments will be stucked and the rest of gratees will never get their assets.

Also Ether distributions can cause problems if gratees will choose a smart contract as a grant receiver and it will have not a receive() or fallback() functions to accept Ethers.

## Impact

Users will not be able to get their assets.

## Recommendation

Better to use pull over the push payment implementation and let users get their assest in the end of the Round by themselves.
