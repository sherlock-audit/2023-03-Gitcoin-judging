# (Not valid, cannot delete) Program owners are not able to manage roles

## Summary

A user that creates a program via `ProgramFactory.sol` and get a `ProgramImplementation` contract is not able to manage operator and admin roles because no functions made for that purpose.

## Vulnerability Detail

`ProgramImplementation` inherits from OpenZeppelin `AccessControlEnumerable.sol` to grantRole for operators and admins. However if there will be any mistake in addresses a user will not be able to revoke role or grant role for a new user because no functions are implemented in the contract. Also `AccessControlEnumerable` _grantRole() and _revokeRole are internal functions and cannot be accessed from ProgramImplementation directly. 

Same situation in `RoundImplementation.sol`

## Impact

In case of any mistake in addresses during a new ProgramImplementation or RoundImplementation contracts creation an admin will not be able to  make changes.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Provide additional functions for revoking and granting roles for users. For example:
`
function grantRole () external onlyOwner {
  _grantRole();
}
`
