# Plaintext votes can result in bribing

## Summary

Votes are not encrypted by default, therefore all information about who an address votes is made public. This information could be used to prove the voted project and claim a bribe, potentially resulting in the matching funds being allocated to less deserving projects.

## Vulnerability Detail

Bribing is a widespread problem in voting and funding protocols, which can be prevented by allowing users to pass on encrypted votes. Encrypted votes to be decrypted off-chain would blend in well with the protocol, as also the vote tallying is done off-chain.

When bribing, the briber would want confirmation that the bribed user would vote for a certain project. With encrypted votes, this would not be possible. 

## Impact

Campaigns with large amount of matching funds could be manipulated via bribing, resulting in funds not being allocated appropriately and defying the purpose of a democratic and fair approach such as quadratic funding.

## Code Snippet

This applies to the `RoundImplementation` contract:

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To encrypt votes, a user could create an ephemeral encryption key based on a shared secret between the round operator and the voter, and use this to encrypt the vote. Given that the calculation is done off-chain, the vote could be decrypted by the round operator and processed accordingly. A possible algorithm could be [ECDH](https://cryptobook.nakov.com/asymmetric-key-ciphers/ecdh-key-exchange).
