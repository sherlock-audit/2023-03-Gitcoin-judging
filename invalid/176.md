# `RoundImplementation` contract can't call the `withdrawFunds` function

## Summary

The `IPayoutStrategy` interface implements a `withdrawFunds` function which is only callable by the `RoundImplementation` contract but because the round contract does not have a way to call the `withdrawFunds`  function, this function can never be called by anyone.

## Vulnerability Detail

All the payout strategy contracts must inherit from `IPayoutStrategy` to be compatible with the `RoundImplementation` contract and thus all those payout strategy contracts will contain a `withdrawFunds` function that is only callable by the `RoundImplementation` contract.

Because in the `RoundImplementation` contract there is no way to make a call to the `withdrawFunds` function, this function can never be called by anyone and subsequently the round contract will not be able to withdraw funds from the payout strategy contract.

## Recommendation

Add a way to call the `withdrawFunds` function in the `RoundImplementation` contract.
