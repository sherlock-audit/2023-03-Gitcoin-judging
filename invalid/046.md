# Funds could be stuck forever if an operator never calls `setReadyForPayout`

## Summary

The function `setReadyForPayout` determines when funds are able to be paid out after a voting round is over. Should this function never be called, due to for instance the round operator losing their private key, or them acting maliciously, funds would be stuck.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function `setReadyForPayout` has the modifier `onlyRole(ROUND_OPERATOR_ROLE)` which determines that only the ROUND OPERATOR role is allowed to prepare the round for finalization. Given that users are able to vote with money (whether this a native token or an ERC20 token), and there is no functionality to withdraw the round token by user, if this function is not called for various reasons, all funds will be stuck forever. 

## Impact

All funds would be stuck.

## Code Snippet

The function can be found inside the `RoundImplementation` contract at this [line](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Gitcoin/blob/main/contracts/contracts/round/RoundImplementation.sol#L443).

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended that the modifier is removed so that anyone can complete a round. This will not open up any other attack vectors, as the beneficiaries of funds are not parameters of the function and thus any account should be able to safely call this function.
