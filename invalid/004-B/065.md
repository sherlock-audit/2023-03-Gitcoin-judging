# According to the documentation roundStartTime should be greater than applicationsEndTime

## Summary

According to the [documentation](https://docs.allo.gitcoin.co/core-concepts/round), a Round goes through three phases: application, voting, and payout. All three of these are marked by timestamps:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Application | after `applicationsStartTime` and before `applicationsEndTime` |
| Selection | after `applicationsEndTime` before `roundStartTime` |
| Voting | after `roundStartTime` and before `roundEndTime` |
| Payout | after `roundEndTime` |

From the table above, we conclude that **roundStartTime** must be greater than **applicationsEndTime**, because **Selection** also requires some time to complete. In `RoundImplementation.initialize`, the **roundStartTime** is required to be greater than or equal to **applicationsStartTime**, which is obviously inconsistent with the document. This breaks the time limit between these phases.

## Vulnerability Detail

Let's take a look at the code snippet for `RoundImplementation.initialize`:

```solidity
function initialize(
    bytes calldata encodedParameters,
    address _alloSettings
  ) external initializer {
    ......

    // slither-disable-next-line timestamp
    require(
      _initRoundTime.applicationsStartTime >= block.timestamp,
      "Round: Time has already passed"
    );
    require(
      _initRoundTime.applicationsEndTime > _initRoundTime.applicationsStartTime,
      "Round: App end is before app start"
    );
    require(
      _initRoundTime.roundEndTime >= _initRoundTime.applicationsEndTime,	//here
      "Round: Round end is before app end"
    );
    require(
      _initRoundTime.roundEndTime > _initRoundTime.roundStartTime,
      "Round: Round end is before round start"
    );
    require(
      _initRoundTime.roundStartTime >= _initRoundTime.applicationsStartTime,	//here
      "Round: Round start is before app start"
    );

    ......
```

Let's take a look at the code snippet for `RoundImplementation.updateStartAndEndTimes`:

```solidity
function updateStartAndEndTimes(
    uint256 newApplicationsStartTime,
    uint256 newApplicationsEndTime,
    uint256 newRoundStartTime,
    uint256 newRoundEndTime
  ) external roundHasNotEnded onlyRole(ROUND_OPERATOR_ROLE) {
    // slither-disable-next-line timestamp
    require(newApplicationsStartTime < newApplicationsEndTime, "Round: Application end is before application start");
    require(newRoundStartTime < newRoundEndTime, "Round: Round end is before round start");
    require(newApplicationsStartTime <= newRoundStartTime, "Round: Round start is before application start");//here
    require(newApplicationsEndTime <= newRoundEndTime, "Round: Round end is before application end");	//here
    require(block.timestamp <= newApplicationsStartTime, "Round: Time has already passed");
```

From the above codes, we can conclude that **\[applicationsStartTime, applicationsEndTime\] may overlap with \[roundStartTime, roundEndTime\]**.

## Impact

This issue can **overlap** the timing of the various phases of the protocol, leading to unexpected errors.
