# `applicationsStartTime` and `applicationsEndTime` can be equal with `roundStartTime` and `roundEndTime` respectively, which can cause weird behaviors

## Summary
In the `initialize()` function and in the `updateStartAndEndTimes()`  that are found in RoundImplementation.sol contract, the `applicationsStartTime` can be equal to `roundStartTime` and `applicationsEndTime` can be equal to `roundEndTime` which can make it so the application period and the voting period to be the same.
## Vulnerability Detail
As is it stated in the Allo Protocol Documentation, there are 4 important phases, after a Round is created, these 4 phases are `Application` , `Selection`, `Voting` and `Payout` and each of these are marked by some timestamps as stated below

The documentation states that `Selection` phase should be after `applicationsEndTime ` and before `roundStartTime` which can indeed be false since the code requires the `roundStartTime` to be >= `applicationsStartTime` and `roundEndTime` to be >= `applicationsEndTime` , so there are could be cases where the `applicationsStartTime` is equal to `roundStartTime` and `applicationsEndTime` is equal to `roundEndTime` which would make the `Selection` phase, stated in the documentation, inexistent. 
## Impact
Letting application time and round time having the same values could led to unexpected behavior like not having enough time for selecting a projects that applied to receive funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Recommendation for this issue would be to change the `>=` with `>` on https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Gitcoin/blob/main/contracts/contracts/round/RoundImplementation.sol#L231-L234 and https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Gitcoin/blob/main/contracts/contracts/round/RoundImplementation.sol#L239-L242 or to change the documentation in a way that would explain the case where `applicationsStartTime` is equal to `roundStartTime` and `applicationsEndTime` is equal to `roundEndTime`.
