# RoundStartTime < ApplicationEndTime

## Summary
![audits](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56475814/229114098-97d8a568-4475-47e7-9d10-6ec51bd987bf.png)
Regarding to image available at https://docs.allo.gitcoin.co/core-concepts/round, 
Selection Happens after applicationsEndTime and before roundStartTime. 
In the `function initialize` we have 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Gitcoin/blob/main/contracts/contracts/round/RoundImplementation.sol#L223-L242
This does not require roundStartTime  to be greater than applicationsEndTime 


## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
This could enable `function vote(bytes[] memory encodedVotes) external payable` to be called while new participants apply with `function applyToRound(bytes32 projectID, MetaPtr calldata newApplicationMetaPtr) external` 

This could destroy the full schedule

## Code Snippet
In `function initialize` we have
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Gitcoin/blob/main/contracts/contracts/round/RoundImplementation.sol#L223-L242

Also we have 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Gitcoin/blob/main/contracts/contracts/round/RoundImplementation.sol#L321-L366

Which can edit the timestamps but has this same vulnerability


## Tool used

Manual Review
FOUNDRY

## Recommendation

`require(roundStartTime > applicationEndTime)`  in both functions
