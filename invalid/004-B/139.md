# The application phase and voting phase can overlap due to the improper setting

## Summary
The application phase and voting phase will overlap if timestamps are not properly calculated due to the incorrectly implemented conditions in the `RoundImplementation` contract. This will lead to a shorter voting phase, and it will affect the voting score of the projects, which will affect the amount of funding that the projects will receive.

## Vulnerability Detail
In one round of the protocol, it's separated into 4 phases according to the [public document](https://docs.allo.gitcoin.co/core-concepts/round), which are application selection voting and payout phase. The phases will be defined in the `initialize()` function, and it can be changed by executing the `updateStartAndEndTimes()` function in the `RoundImplementation` contract.

However, both functions do not properly check the `applicationsEndTime` and `roundStartTime` variables that separate the application and voting phases, and they should not overlap. In the event that the two phases overlap, the voting phase will be shorter than it should be, which will affect the amount of funding that the projects will receive.

## Impact
The voting phase will be shorter than it should be, and it will affect the amount of funding that the projects will receive.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
We recommend implementing a condition to verify that the application and voting phases are completely separated, and it should be long enough to support the selection phase, as shown in the example below.

```solidity
uint256 SELECTION_PHASE_PERIOD = 5 days; 
require(
  roundStartTime >= applicationsEndTime + SELECTION_PHASE_PERIOD,
  "Round: Round start is before selection end"
);
```
