# RoundImplementation contract should check that `roundStartTime` > `applicationsEndTime`

## Summary

In the RoundImplementation contract the `roundStartTime` can be set before the `applicationsEndTime` which means that the selection phase mentioned in the [docs](https://docs.allo.gitcoin.co/core-concepts/round#rounds-in-depth) can not be implemented and the voting phase will start while the application phase is still ongoing.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the RoundImplementation contract there two ways of setting the round and application timestamps : in the `initialize` function and the function `updateStartAndEndTimes`, both those functions have the same input checks that are shown below :

```solidity
require(newApplicationsStartTime < newApplicationsEndTime, "Round: Application end is before application start");
require(newRoundStartTime < newRoundEndTime, "Round: Round end is before round start");
require(newApplicationsStartTime <= newRoundStartTime, "Round: Round start is before application start");
require(newApplicationsEndTime <= newRoundEndTime, "Round: Round end is before application end");
require(block.timestamp <= newApplicationsStartTime, "Round: Time has already passed");
```

Those checks ensue the following :

* `applicationsEndTime` > `applicationsStartTime`

* `roundStartTime` > `applicationsStartTime`

* `roundEndTime` > `roundStartTime`

* `roundEndTime` > `applicationsEndTime`

* `applicationsStartTime` is not in the past

None of this checks ensure that the round start time `roundStartTime` comes after the application end time `applicationsEndTime` and thus the selection period could sometimes not be implemented and the voting process will start while the application process is still open.

## Impact

The round selection phase mentioned in the [docs](https://docs.allo.gitcoin.co/core-concepts/round#rounds-in-depth) can not be implemented and the voting phase will start while the application phase is still ongoing.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add a check statement in the instances mentioned previously (in the code snippet) to ensure that `roundStartTime` is always greater than `applicationsEndTime`.
