# `roundStartTime` can be before `applicationsEndTime` disadvantaging certain applicants

## Summary

`roundStartTime` can be before `applicationsEndTime` disadvantaging certain applicants
## Vulnerability Detail

The intended flow of rounds is:

Voting should therefore only begin when applications have ended. In the current contract implementation, there is a missing check to ensure that `roundStartTime` can not be before than `applicationsEndTime`. The check implemented ontly requires that `roundStartTime` can not be before than `applicationsStartTime`

```solidity
    require(
      _initRoundTime.roundStartTime >= _initRoundTime.applicationsStartTime,
      "Round: Round start is before app start"
    );
```
This is the same check in `updateStartAndEndTimes`

```solidity
require(newApplicationsStartTime <= newRoundStartTime, "Round: Round start is before application start");
```

This means that applications would continue even when voting has already started.

## Impact

Applicants whose applications are after voting starts are disadvantaged. Some votes would already have been done on a smaller subset of applicants. Note that an application can be submitted and approved while voting is in progress.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add a require statement where: `roundStartTime > applicationsEndTime`
