# LOCK_DURATION setter is missing

## Summary
LOCK_DURATION is initialized at 0 days, but we can't get this to work because we don't have a setter.
## Vulnerability Detail
LOCK_DURATION does not provide a setter, even though it is an important variable in imposing constraints. The operation proceeds without the necessary control.
## Impact
conditions incorporating LOCK_DURATION don't work well.
