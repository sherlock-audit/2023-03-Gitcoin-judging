# The `LOCK_DURATION` can never be changed, which lead to be always no locking duration for the round

## Summary
The `LOCK_DURATION` can never be changed, which lead to be always no locking duration for the round.

## Vulnerability Detail
Within the IPayoutStrategy,
the `LOCK_DURATION` would be defined and then `0 days` would be assigned into there as an initial value like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Gitcoin/blob/main/contracts/contracts/payoutStrategy/IPayoutStrategy.sol#L36
```solidity
  /// @notice Locking duration
  uint256 public constant LOCK_DURATION = 0 days;
```

Within the IPayoutStrategy#`withdrawFunds()`,
the `LOCK_DURATION` would be used for the validation like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Gitcoin/blob/main/contracts/contracts/payoutStrategy/IPayoutStrategy.sol#L147
```solidity
  /**
   * @notice Invoked by RoundImplementation to withdraw funds to
   * withdrawAddress from the payout contract
   *
   * @param withdrawAddress withdraw funds address
   */
  function withdrawFunds(address payable withdrawAddress) external payable virtual isRoundOperator {

    uint roundEndTime = RoundImplementation(roundAddress).roundEndTime();
    require(block.timestamp >= roundEndTime + LOCK_DURATION, "Lock duration has not ended");  /// @audit 
    ...
```

However, there is no setter function to assign new locking duration into the `LOCK_DURATION`.
As a result, the locking duration assigned in the `LOCK_DURATION` will be always the initial value (`0 days`) forever unless the payout strategy contract will be upgraded.


## Impact
It lead to be always no locking duration for the round.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding a setter function to the IPayoutStrategy contract in order to assign new `locking duration` into the `LOCK_DURATION` like this:
```solidity
abstract contract IPayoutStrategy {
    ...

+   function setLockDuration(uint256 _newLockDuration) external onlyOwner {
+       LOCK_DURATION = _newLockDuration;
+   }
```
