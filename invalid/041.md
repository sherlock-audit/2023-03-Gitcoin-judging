# Assets used to vote may be lost if round is misconfigured

## Summary
Calling the `vote` function in `RoundImplementation.sol` with native tokens may lead to the tokens being lost without casting a vote. This happens when the voting strategy is not properly initialized.

## Vulnerability Detail
The payable `vote` functions sends the native tokens used to vote as follows:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Gitcoin/blob/main/contracts/contracts/round/RoundImplementation.sol#L438
```solidity
votingStrategy.vote{value: msg.value}(encodedVotes, msg.sender);
```

Since `votingStrategy` is initialized in the constructor and can't be updated, there is a risk of a misconfiguration where it is wrong or remains the zero address. The contract only calls the functions `init` and `vote` on this address and no additional checks are performed. None of the calls will revert in this scenario.

Specifically when voting, `msg.value` will be lost but the vote will not be cast (as the vote event is not emitted). Even though the round contract has a `withdraw` function for rescuing locked tokens it doesn't support the token which is actually used for the matching fund so it will not be useful in this scenario.

## Impact
Users voting in a misconfigured round will lose their tokens without casting a vote.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Either enforce that `votingStrategy` is in a whitelist of known voting strategy contracts or have the function `vote` as defined in `IVotingStrategy.sol` return some value which will indicate the vote is successful and check it in the round contract to avoid "no-op & no-revert" errors.

Moreover, the `RoundImplementation.sol` lacks basic checks for parameters controlled by the round operator. I am aware that the operator is considered a trusted entity (and is not incentivized to sabotage the round itself) but I would look at the contract again considering the fact that a round operator can damage either the protocol or users by being malicious or just not careful enough.
