https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20#revert-on-zero-value-transfers

> Some tokens (e.g. LEND) revert when transferring a zero value amount.

> example: [RevertZero.sol](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20/blob/main/src/RevertZero.sol)

then Fund distribution will not be successful and revert if the underlying token revert in 0 balance transfer

## Impact

Fund distribution will not be successful and revert if the underlying token revert in 0 balance transfer
