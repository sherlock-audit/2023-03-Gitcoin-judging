# DOS issue if `_token` is Ether(native) and `_grantAddress` rejects Ether transfers

## Summary
The `vote(bytes[] calldata encodedVotes, address voterAddress)` function allows a voter to cast weighted votes to multiple grants during a round. However, there is a potential Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability if the `_grantAddress` rejects Ether transfers when `_token` is `address(0)`.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `vote()` function iterates through encoded votes and transfers funds to the respective grant addresses. When the `_token` is Ã ddress(0)`, the function uses `AddressUpgradeable.sendValue(payable(_grantAddress), _amount)` to transfer Ether.
If the `_grantAddress` is a contract that rejects Ether transfers, this can result in a Denial of Service (DoS) attack, where the entire `vote()` function fails due to the failed transfer.

## Impact
Disrupt the voting process and prevent other legitimate grant transfers from being executed.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
When sending ether if the ether is rejected wrapped to WETH and send WETH, if you want you could also review your code and remove native ether transfers and enforce WETH
