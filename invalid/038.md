# addProjectOwner leaves only one owner in list

## Summary

The function of the project registry `addProjectOwner()` results in a linked list with a single owner (the newly added one) and a floating owner not linked anymore.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function does the following:

```solidity
        owners.list[newOwner] = owners.list[OWNERS_LIST_SENTINEL];
        owners.list[OWNERS_LIST_SENTINEL] = newOwner;
        owners.count++;
```

After newOwner is added, the list is: `OWNERS_LIST_SENTINEL -> newOwner -> OWNERS_LIST_SENTINEL` and `oldOwner -> OWNERS_LIST_SENTINEL`.

It should have been `OWNERS_LIST_SENTINEL -> oldOwner -> newOwner -> OWNERS_LIST_SENTINEL` (or switching the order of old/new owner).

## Impact

The function to get the list of owners that traverses the linked list will only return `[newOwner, 0x00...]` while it should return `[oldOwner, newOwner]`. The owners count is still increased, adding discrepancy.

```solidity
function getProjectOwners(uint256 projectID) external view returns(address[] memory) {
        OwnerList storage owners = projectsOwners[projectID];

        address[] memory list = new address[](owners.count);

        uint256 index = 0;
        address current = owners.list[OWNERS_LIST_SENTINEL];

        if (current == address(0x0)) {
            return list;
        }

        while (current != OWNERS_LIST_SENTINEL) {
            list[index] = current;
            current = owners.list[current];
            index++;
        }

        return list;
    }
```
