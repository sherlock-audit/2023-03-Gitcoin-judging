# Round variables are not checkpointed at the start of a round

## Summary

The owner of the `AlloSettings` contract can update state variables `protocolTreasury` and `protocolFeePercentage` at any point in time, but the `RoundImplementation` only uses the values at the end of the round when `setReadyForPayout` is called.

Similarly, a round operator can update `roundFeePercentage` and `roundFeeAddress` in the `RoundImplementation` with the same effect.

## Vulnerability Detail

During the life of a round, the variables in `AlloSettings` can be changed by the owner of the `AlloSettings` contract, and the state variables in the `RoundImplementation` can be changed by a round operator. Participants in the funding round may take actions based on economic assumptions including the current value of `protocolFeePercentage` and `roundFeeAddress` . These assumptions can be violated, after funds are committed to the round, at the end of round period.

## Impact

For example, `protocolFeePercentage` could be set to its maximum value at the conclusion of the round, pereventing `setReadyForPayout` from completing successfully until sufficient tokens are deposited.

## Tool used

Manual review

## Recommendation

Consider storing the previous values of `protocolTreasury`, `protocolFeePercentage`, `roundFeePercentage`, and `roundFeeAddress` for the current round before updating any of the state variables. This can be accomplished using a struct to hold pertinent round information and a mapping of the unique round to round data struct.
