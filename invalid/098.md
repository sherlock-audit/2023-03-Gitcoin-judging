# ETH sent by users in error cannot be retrieved.

## Summary
The `MarklePayoutStrategyImplementation` inherits from `IPayoutStrategy`, and since `receive() external payable {}` is defined, anyone can send ETH. However, if it is ERC20 that is used in the round, there is no way to get the ETH back.
## Vulnerability Detail
It appears that funds can be withdrawn by `withdrawFunds(address payable withdrawAddress)` when `tokenAddress == address(0)`. `tokenAddress` is defined in `init()` and once defined It cannot be changed. Therefore, if `tokenAddress` is ERC20 and a user transfers ETH by mistake, ETH will be stuck.
## Impact
Can't get the user's ETH back.
