# Fake Applications Resulting from Unauthorized Submissions

## Summary
 The current system allows anyone to submit applications on behalf of a project during a round, creating the potential for fake applications and confusion among end-users. To maintain the integrity of the application process, it is essential to implement an authorization mechanism ensuring that only the genuine project team can submit applications for their project.
## Vulnerability Detail
When a round is created for a program, anyone can submit applications on behalf of a project, leading to the possibility of fake applications and confusion for end-users.

Example: Assume GitCoin has a program running a round. When the round's applications open, a project called PandaChads applies for a grant with an application meta pointer outlining their promises. A malicious actor could then use PandaChads' projectId to create another application with a different meta pointer, indicating different promises of which the PandaChads team is unaware. This could lead to confusion when people vote, as they cannot be certain if the application was genuinely proposed by the official PandaChads team or someone else.
## Impact
Since this will lead to chaos for end-users and project owners, I'll label it as medium

No checks if the msg.sender indeed the projects authorized user
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check if msg.sender is eligible for creating an application behalf of the project
