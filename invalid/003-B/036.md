# A malicious user can DoS a Round with fake projectIDs

## Summary

In case of Gitcoin will work on L2 chains where transaction cost is very low, a malicious user can apply to Round unlimited fake IDs and make Round too hard to launch.

## Vulnerability Detail

A vunnerability hides in applyToRound() functions that has no checks if that specific `projectID` exist or was added before as well as no checks who can apply for it. Any user can pass a fake info as arguments into the functions and couse trubles in selecting real projects for funding.

## Impact

There is a possibility that because of great number of fake projectIDs any Round will be difficult to launch.

## Recommendation

Provide additional checks if the current projectId was added before. Or make only project owners be able to apply for a Round.
