# Use of safeTransfer in RoundImplementation does not return a bool as it should for IERC20 standard

## Summary
Use of safeTransfer in RoundImplementation does not return a bool as it should for IERC20 standard token transfers

## Vulnerability Detail

The safeTransfer function in the SafeERC20 library is designed to handle this case by calling the token's transfer function and checking its return value. If the transfer fails, the function will revert and the transaction will be rolled back.

## Impact
This means that if the transfer fails for some reason, such as the contract not having sufficient funds, there will be no error thrown and the contract will continue executing as if the transfer was successful.

This is a potential vulnerability because it could result in funds being lost or stolen if the contract does not handle the failure of the transfer correctly. It's generally best practice to use the return value of safeTransfer and handle any errors that might occur, rather than relying on the contract to continue executing as normal.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
  Mitigated code:

Therefore, if you want to ensure that the token transfers are performed safely, you should modify the setReadyForPayout function to check the return value of safeTransfer

```solidity
   if (token == address(0)) {
      require(payoutStrategy.setReadyForPayout{value: fundsInContract}(), "Transfer of ETH to payout contract failed");
    } else {
      require(IERC20(token).safeTransfer(address(payoutStrategy), fundsInContract), "Transfer of tokens to payout contract failed");
      require(payoutStrategy.setReadyForPayout(), "Setting payout strategy ready for payout failed");
    }
```
