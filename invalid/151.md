# Loss of funds through roundFeeAddress

## Summary
The function initialize in RoundImplementation lacks zero checks for the ` address payable _roundFeeAddress` 

## Vulnerability Detail

In the initialize function, roundFeeAddress is set


 ` function initialize(  ) external initializer {
   roundFeePercentage = _roundFeePercentage;
    roundFeeAddress = _roundFeeAddress;
  }  `


In the `updateRoundFeeAddress` function, it also lacks a zero address check.
` function updateRoundFeeAddress(address payable newFeeAddress) external roundHasNotEnded onlyRole(ROUND_OPERATOR_ROLE) {
    roundFeeAddress = newFeeAddress;
    emit RoundFeeAddressUpdated(roundFeeAddress);
  }`
## Impact

This can lead to loss of funds to address(0) where it can never be recovered from.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

`require( _roundFeeAddress != address(0);` should be added to `function initialize` 
`require(newFeeAddress != address(0);` should be added to `updateRoundFeeAddress`
