# payout could be blocked permanently if matchAmount is set to too high

## Summary
payout could be blocked permanently if matchAmount is set to too high

## Vulnerability Detail
In RoundImplementation, setReadyForPayout requires the amount of fund in the contract to be no smaller than the required matchAmount, plus whatever protocol/& round fee. However the admin update of matchAmount can only be set upwards, but never downwards. It means if the admin accidentally, or over-confidently set a high amount, would block the setReadyForPayout until the fund in the contract meets the matchAmount. The worst case is the fund would be stuck permanently if the matchAmount is never reached.

## Impact
setReadyForPayout would be blocked.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Create an admin update that can update the matchAmount to the latest fundInContract, but only callable after the round has ended is one possibility to proceed with payout.
```solidity
  function updateMatchAmountPostRound() external roundHasEnded onlyRole(ROUND_OPERATOR_ROLE) {
    uint256 fundsInContract = _getTokenBalance(token);
    matchAmount = fundsInContract;
    emit MatchAmountUpdated(matchAmount);
  }

```
Alternatively, Allow a way to "return" the fund if the round has ended but the amount of contribution does not meet the matchAmount
