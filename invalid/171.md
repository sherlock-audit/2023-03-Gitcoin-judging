# `roundFeePercentage` does not have upper bound

## Summary

`roundFeePercentage` can be set without an upper bound value check so the operator can set it to a value greater than the `denominator = 100000` (by accident or intentionnally), this will send a large portion of the payout to the round fee address and can potentialy lead to the revert of the `setReadyForPayout()` function call. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The value of `roundFeePercentage` represent the percentage of the payout that goes to the round as a fee, it maximum value should be 100000 which is equivalent to 100%, but because there is no check to enforce that `roundFeePercentage` is always less than 100000 it can be set to a larger value.

The impact of this is that a large portion of payout will be send as a round fee, and more importantly if the `roundFeePercentage` is set very high this can block the call to the function `setReadyForPayout()` because of this check :

```solidity
uint256 protocolFeeAmount = (matchAmount * alloSettings.protocolFeePercentage()) / denominator;
uint256 roundFeeAmount = (matchAmount * roundFeePercentage) / denominator;

// total funds needed for payout
uint256 neededFunds = matchAmount + protocolFeeAmount + roundFeeAmount;

require(fundsInContract >= neededFunds, "Round: Not enough funds in contract");
```

As you can see if the value of `roundFeePercentage` is high then the value of `roundFeeAmount` will also be high and thus the check statment can revert because `neededFunds` will surpass the contract balance.

## Recommendation

To avoid this issue i recommend to add a check statement in the instances mentioned (in the code snippet) to verify that the `roundFeePercentage` is always less than then the denominator.
