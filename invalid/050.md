# Votes can be manipulated by flashloan or duplicate votes

## Summary
When user votes, the grants with votes are transferred to the project's `_grantAddress` directly. So users can manipulate votes by flashloan or duplicate votes

## Vulnerability Detail
Let's suppose `_grantAddress` is owned by project owners. Then a project can manipulate votes by using flash loans. E.g. the following operations can be wrapped in one tx,
1. User borrows from flashloan
2. The flashloan is used as grants with votes
3. During the vote the grant is transferred to `_grantAddress`
4. Since `_grantAddress` is controlled by project, it just withdraw those grants and payback flashloan

For same mechanism, user can use same amount of tokens to duplicate votes.

## Impact
Votes are manipulated by malicious projects.

## Recommendation
When user votes save the grants in a Vault, and only enable withdraw when round ends.
