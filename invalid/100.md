# Protocol Treasury can be set to Null

## Summary

There is no check for the null address during the implementation of update protocol treasury function.

## Vulnerability Detail

It is possible for the owner of the contract to set the protocol treasury address to null by passing in the value 0 as the _protocolTreasury parameter. In such a scenario, any subsequent operations that rely on the protocol treasury address may fail or behave unexpectedly.

It is not a great practice to allow setting of the address to null unless it is intentional and necessary for the functionality of the contract. It is advisable to add a check in the function to ensure that the _protocolTreasury parameter is not equal to 0 before setting the protocolTreasury variable. 

At first glance, we may not think of this as a vulnerability. However, there are numerous instances where we have heard about the private keys of the deployer being compromised. Or the keys of the other admins or owners of the contract being compromised. If the access control gets compromised, this functionality can be easily abused. This could further in a loss of funds for the contract, and may compromise the security and integrity of the protocol.

## Impact

## Code Snippet

```solidity
/// @notice Set the protocol treasury address
  /// @param _protocolTreasury The new protocol treasury address
  function updateProtocolTreasury(address payable _protocolTreasury) external onlyOwner {
    protocolTreasury = _protocolTreasury;
    emit ProtocolTreasuryUpdated(protocolTreasury);
  }
```

change it to : 

```solidity
function updateProtocolTreasury(address payable _protocolTreasury) external onlyOwner {
  require(_protocolTreasury != address(0), "Protocol treasury cannot be set to null");
  protocolTreasury = _protocolTreasury;
  emit ProtocolTreasuryUpdated(protocolTreasury);
}
```

## Recommendation

Add a check to ensure that the protocol treasury address is not set to null.
