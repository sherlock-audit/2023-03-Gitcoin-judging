# One project owner address can remove all other owners

## Summary

The project owners in the `ProjectRegistry` contract all share equal power and lack incentives to cooperate.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `ProjectRegistry` contract, each project has an associated list of [owners](https://github.com/allo-protocol/contracts/blob/36dc33762c396660c0a84f6ef7d790f632638e81/contracts/projectRegistry/ProjectRegistry.sol#L49). The [`onlyProjectOwner`](https://github.com/allo-protocol/contracts/blob/36dc33762c396660c0a84f6ef7d790f632638e81/contracts/projectRegistry/ProjectRegistry.sol#L60-L63) modifier grants access to management functions to address in this list.

Since one project owner has complete management access to the project, this provides no security advantage over letting projects choose to use a multisig address or other governance mechanism.

## Impact

A single project owner can 1) remove all other project owners and then 2) update the off-chain link in the `MetaPtr`. This can cause problems for off-chain consumers of the `ProjectRegistry`, and the former project owners will have no recourse for recovery.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider using a single address as a project owner, returning control over management functions in `ProjectRegistry` to the project's community.
