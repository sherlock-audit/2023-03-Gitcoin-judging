# Precision loss in function setReadyForPayout

## Summary
There is a danger of precision loss in the calculation to return protocolFeeAmount and roundFeeAmount

## Vulnerability Detail
The division operation 
```solidity
matchAmount * alloSettings.protocolFeePercentage() / denominator
```


```solidity
matchAmount * roundFeePercentage) / denominator
```

Could result in precision loss if the values are not properly scaled.

For example, if matchAmount is equal to 10^18 and alloSettings.protocolFeePercentage() 
and roundFeePercentage are both equal to 1%, the result of the division operation would be (10^18 * 1%) / 100% = 10^16. 
However, since 10^16 is greater than the maximum value that can be represented by a uint256 integer (2^256-1), the result would be truncated, resulting in a loss of precision.

## Impact
If the calculation for protocolFeeAmount or roundFeeAmount results in a loss of precision, it could lead to an incorrect amount being
deducted from the contract and sent to the protocol treasury or the round fee address. Similarly, if the calculation for neededFunds results in a loss of precision, it could lead to an incorrect amount being compared against the balance of the contract, which could result in an incorrect "Not enough funds in contract" error or allow an incorrect payout.

## Recommendation
To mitigate this issue, set the values to fixed point decimals and use safeMath library arithmetic operations.

   // calculate fees using SafeMath library
```solidity
    uint256 protocolFeeAmount = matchAmount.mul(protocolFeePercentage).div(denominator);
    uint256 roundFeeAmount = matchAmount.mul(roundFeePercentage).div(denominator);

```
