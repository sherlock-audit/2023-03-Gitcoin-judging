# Two address tokens can be withdrawn by the operator even if used for matching fund

## Summary
If a round has began with a [two address token](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20#multiple-token-addresses) (e.g. a proxied token), the operator can withdraw the matching fund while round is active despite the check in the `withdraw` function attempting to restrict this behavior.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `withdraw` function in `RoundImplementation.sol` is used to withdraw tokens sent to the round contract if they are not the token used for the round. It can only be called by a round operator an behaves as follows:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Gitcoin/blob/main/contracts/contracts/round/RoundImplementation.sol#L484-L485
```solidity
  require(tokenAddress != token, "Round: Cannot withdraw round token");
  _transferAmount(recipent, _getTokenBalance(tokenAddress), tokenAddress);
```

Observe that if the token address is not unique, the matching fund can be drained by the operator even before the round has ended. It appears that the project's intention is to limit such withdrawals at least until the round has ended and a lock duration has passed, as seen in the `withdrawFunds` function in `IPayoutStrategy.sol`: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Gitcoin/blob/main/contracts/contracts/payoutStrategy/IPayoutStrategy.sol#L147

## Impact
The round operator can steal the matching fund.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Even though the round operator is trusted, it seems the contract wishes to limits his power by not allowing reducing the matching amount or withdrawing tokens which are used for the matching fund. To mitigate the risk of this vulnerability, the `withdraw` function should verify that the balance of the relevant token is unchanged.
