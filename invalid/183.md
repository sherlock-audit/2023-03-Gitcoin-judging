# RoundImplementation can be front-runned and initialized by a malicious user

## Summary
A malicious user can frontrun and call the init function in RoundImplementation and take control of the business logic

## Vulnerability Detail
An attacker can call the initialize function and therefore assign themselves privaleged roles, such as DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE
and ROUND_OPERATOR_ROLE. In turn, can then call all the functions assigned to this Modifier role, including both functions:
```solidity
function withdraw(address tokenAddress, address payable recipent) external onlyRole(ROUND_OPERATOR_ROLE) {```

function setReadyForPayout() external payable roundHasEnded onlyRole(ROUND_OPERATOR_ROLE) {
```

to name a few. Subsequently, Bob, now calling the Initializer in ```roundImplementation``` can also the init functions in both ```IPayoutStratgey``` and ```IVotingStrategy```. 

Calling the init function in IPayoutStrategy 

* @notice Invoked by RoundImplementation on creation to
   * set the round for which the payout strategy is to be used
   *
```solidity  
function init() external {
    require(roundAddress == address(0x0), "roundAddress already set");
    roundAddress = payable(msg.sender);

    // set the token address
    tokenAddress = RoundImplementation(roundAddress).token();

    isReadyForPayout = false;
  }
```
And now, the attacker has the ```roundAddress``` under control, and can now also call 
```solidity
function setReadyForPayout() external payable isRoundContract roundHasEnded {
    require(isReadyForPayout == false, "isReadyForPayout already set");
    isReadyForPayout = true;
    emit ReadyForPayout();
  }
```
and can then call ```function withdrawFunds(address payable withdrawAddress) external payable virtual isRoundOperator {```
passing an address of their choice, 

## Impact
This means that anyone who has control of the roundAddress and admin roles can effectively take control of the entire round, including its funds, participants, and payout strategy. The protocols' business logic.

Note: I have submitted this as a high due to the fact that loss of funds is a realistic scenario. I have submitted a similar issue regarding the IVoting exposure that happens in the same fashion as above, but as a medium.

Vs Code
Manual Review

## Recommendation
I would suggest to protect key functions like below:

```solidity
function initialize(bytes calldata encodedParameters, address _alloSettings) external Initializer onlyOwner {
```

```solidity
function init() internal {
  require(roundAddress == address(0x0), "roundAddress already set");
  roundAddress = address(this);
```
