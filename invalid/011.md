# Use of long require statements

## Summary

Using shorter revert strings reduces the amount of gas consumed by require statements, which can help reduce the cost of transactions for users. Shorter strings also help keep the bytecode size of the smart contract smaller, which can help reduce deployment costs and improve overall contract performance.

## Vulnerability Detail

When a require statement fails, it causes the entire transaction to revert, which means that all the gas used by the transaction up to that point is lost. This includes the gas that was used to run the require statement and any other code in the transaction.

It is still important to provide enough context in the revert string to help users understand why the require statement failed. A good balance is to use short, descriptive error messages that convey the reason for the failure without being unnecessarily verbose.

## Impact

Gas Optimization

## Code Snippet

require(newApplicationsStartTime < newApplicationsEndTime, "Round: Application end is before application start");
require(newRoundStartTime < newRoundEndTime, "Round: Round end is before round start");
require(newApplicationsStartTime <= newRoundStartTime, "Round: Round start is before application start");
require(newApplicationsEndTime <= newRoundEndTime, "Round: Round end is before application end");
require(block.timestamp <= newApplicationsStartTime, "Round: Time has already passed");

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use shorter revert strings. Also, use custom errors instead of revert strings for gas savings.
