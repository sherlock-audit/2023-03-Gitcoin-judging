# Use `bytes32` instead of `string` for the `pointer` field in `MetaPtr` struct

## Summary

The `MetaPtr` struct uses a `string` data type for the `pointer` field, which is less efficient and flexible than using `bytes32`. This issue suggests changing the `pointer` field to use the `bytes32` data type instead.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the current implementation, the `MetaPtr` struct is defined as:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Gitcoin/blob/main/contracts/contracts/utils/MetaPtr.sol#L4-L12
```solidity
struct MetaPtr {
  uint256 protocol;
  string pointer;
}
```
The `pointer` field is a `string`, which is not as efficient in terms of gas usage and can cause additional complexity when working with the data. Since the provided example pointer, `QmPMERYmqZtbHmqd2UzRhX9F4cixnMQU2GFa2hYAsQ6J3D`, can be represented as a `bytes32` value, it is recommended to use `bytes32` for the `pointer` field.

## Impact

By changing the `pointer` field to `bytes32`, gas usage will be optimized, and working with the data will be more straightforward. This change will also make the implementation more consistent with common practices when working with content hashes like IPFS hashes.
