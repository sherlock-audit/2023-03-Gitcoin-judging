# Program can be created with no admin or operator

## Summary

During program initialization, there are no checks to ensure that a program has at least one admin. This can result in invalid programs being indexed.

## Vulnerability Detail

When a program is created it is initialized with passed in `encodedParameters` that includes address arrays for admins and operators.

```solidity
function initialize(bytes calldata encodedParameters) external initializer {
    // Decode _encodedParameters
    (
        MetaPtr memory _metaPtr,
        address[] memory _adminRoles,
        address[] memory _programOperators
    ) = abi.decode(encodedParameters, (MetaPtr, address[], address[]));

    // Emit MetaPtrUpdated event for indexing
    emit MetaPtrUpdated(metaPtr, _metaPtr);
    metaPtr = _metaPtr;

    // Assigning default admin role
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < _adminRoles.length; ++i) {
        _grantRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, _adminRoles[i]);
    }

    // Assigning program operators
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < _programOperators.length; ++i) {
        _grantRole(PROGRAM_OPERATOR_ROLE, _programOperators[i]);
    }
}
```

However, there is no check to ensure that the passed in arrays are not empty. This can result in programs being created that are dead on arrival, with no way to update them.

## Impact

These "unowned" programs create additional noise and complexity for the indexer.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Ensure that there is at least one admin when a program is created. 

This can be handled in a similar way as the `ProjectRegistry` contract, where access control is configured with `msg.sender` as the default admin, or by checking that the passed in array is not empty.
