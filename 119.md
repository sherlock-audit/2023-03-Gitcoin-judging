# roundFeePercentage is not verified in initialize and updateRoundFeePercentage functions

## Summary

roundFeePercentage is not verified in initialize and updateRoundFeePercentage functions. This can lead to roundFeePercentage is set to extremely large number and the round can never achieve needed funds; also it causes donators to pay unreasonable round fee.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `RoundImplementation` contract, both `initialize` and `updateRoundFeePercentage` does not verify if `roundFeePercentage` is larger than `denominator`, this could lead to the round fee > 100% and even extremely large
```solidity
function updateRoundFeePercentage(uint32 newFeePercentage) external roundHasNotEnded onlyRole(ROUND_OPERATOR_ROLE) {
    roundFeePercentage = newFeePercentage;
    emit RoundFeePercentageUpdated(roundFeePercentage);
  }
```

Yet in  `AlloSettings.sol` contract, the protocol fee is checked in `updateProtocolFeePercentage` function:
```solidity
function updateProtocolFeePercentage(uint24 _protocolFeePercentage) external onlyOwner {

    require(_protocolFeePercentage <= DENOMINATOR , "value exceeds 100%");

    protocolFeePercentage = _protocolFeePercentage;
    emit ProtocolFeePercentageUpdated(protocolFeePercentage);
  }
```

## Impact
- Round fee could be set to > 100% or even extremely large number

Manual Review

## Recommendation
I recommend only allows setting `roundFeePercentage` <= `denominator`
