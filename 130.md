# User can vote unselected projects and waste token for nothing

## Summary
As per [Allo Protocol Documentation](https://docs.allo.gitcoin.co/core-concepts/round), the Round process is like below:

It basically means that only the selected projects could be voted on, but there in no checking on if one project is selected and user can vote on any projects.

## Vulnerability Detail
User calls _**vote(bytes[] memory)**_  in [RoundImplementation.sol ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Gitcoin/blob/main/contracts/contracts/round/RoundImplementation.sol) to vote, which in turn calls _**vote(bytes[] calldata, address)**_ in [QuadraticFundingVotingStrategyImplementation.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Gitcoin/blob/main/contracts/contracts/votingStrategy/QuadraticFundingStrategy/QuadraticFundingVotingStrategyImplementation.sol) to transfer voting token from user to project (_grantAddress). 

## Impact
If the project user voted on is not selected by protocol, user just wasted funds for nothing.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Please consider strengthen the check on the vote to check with the actual application, allow user to vote on selected projects only.
