# Protocol will lose out on fees for tokens with low decimals

## Summary

Protocol will lose out on fees for tokens with low decimals

## Vulnerability Detail

The protocol calculates the round fee as below:

```solidity
uint256 protocolFeeAmount = (matchAmount * alloSettings.protocolFeePercentage()) / denominator;
uint256 roundFeeAmount = (matchAmount * roundFeePercentage) / denominator;
```

where `DENOMINATOR = 100000`

This fails to take into account that there can be tokens of high value with low decimals. Lets say we have a token with 1 decimal and a fee of 0.01% i.e a value of 10 has been set.

```solidity
 /// @notice Protocol fee percentage
  /// 100% = 100_000 | 10% = 10_000 | 1% = 1_000 | 0.1% = 100 | 0.01% = 10
```

If the `matchAmount` is say `100` of the token. The value with the decimals included will be `100 * 10**1 = 1000`

Now when calculating the  `protocolFeeAmount`, the result will be 0

```solidity
(1000 * 10)100000 = 0
```

That means the protocol will lose out on the fees.
It should be noted that the value of token may be high making the loss a substantial amount.

## Impact

Protocol will lose out on fees for tokens with very low decimals.
