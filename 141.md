# ERC20 transfer zero amount can be reverted

## Summary
Certain ERC-20 tokens do not support zero-value token transfers and revert.
As ERC20 can be an arbitrary token, in the case when such token doesn't allow for zero amount transfers.
## Vulnerability Detail
All functions in the Code snippet below they don't check for zero amount transfer.
file contracts/contracts/payoutStrategy/IPayoutStrategy.sol :
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Gitcoin/blob/main/contracts/contracts/payoutStrategy/IPayoutStrategy.sol#L144-L167

```solidity
function withdrawFunds(address payable withdrawAddress) external payable virtual isRoundOperator {

    uint roundEndTime = RoundImplementation(roundAddress).roundEndTime();
    require(block.timestamp >= roundEndTime + LOCK_DURATION, "Lock duration has not ended");


    uint balance = _getTokenBalance();

    if (tokenAddress == address(0)) { 
      /// @dev native token
      AddressUpgradeable.sendValue(
        withdrawAddress,
        balance
      );
    } else { 
      /// @dev ERC20 token
      IERC20Upgradeable(tokenAddress).safeTransfer(//@audit-info
        withdrawAddress,
        balance
      );
    }

    emit FundsWithdrawn(tokenAddress, balance, withdrawAddress);
  }
```

As can be seen from the function nowhere is there a check for zero amount transfer.

file: RoundImplementation.sol function
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Gitcoin/blob/main/contracts/contracts/round/RoundImplementation.sol#L483-L486
```solidity
function withdraw(address tokenAddress, address payable recipent) external onlyRole(ROUND_OPERATOR_ROLE) {
    require(tokenAddress != token, "Round: Cannot withdraw round token");
    _transferAmount(recipent, _getTokenBalance(tokenAddress), tokenAddress);
  }
```

As can be seen from the function itself which also calls _transferAmount() , nowhere is there a check for zero amount transfer.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Gitcoin/blob/main/contracts/contracts/round/RoundImplementation.sol#L502-L508
```solidity
 function _transferAmount(address payable _recipient, uint256 _amount, address _tokenAddress) private {
    if (_tokenAddress == address(0)) {
      Address.sendValue(_recipient, _amount);
    } else {
      IERC20(_tokenAddress).safeTransfer(_recipient, _amount);//@audit-info safeTransfer
    }
  }
```

function _distribute(Distribution calldata _distribution) private {
    uint256 _index = _distribution.index;
    address _grantee = _distribution.grantee;
    uint256 _amount = _distribution.amount;
    bytes32 _projectId = _distribution.projectId;
    bytes32[] memory _merkleProof = _distribution.merkleProof;

    require(!hasBeenDistributed(_index), "Payout: Already distributed");

    /* We need double hashing to prevent second preimage attacks */
    bytes32 node = keccak256(bytes.concat(keccak256(abi.encode(_index, _grantee, _amount, _projectId))));

    require(MerkleProof.verify(_merkleProof, merkleRoot, node), "Payout: Invalid proof");

    _setDistributed(_index);

    _transferAmount(payable(_grantee), _amount);

    emit FundsDistributed(
      _amount,
      _grantee,
      tokenAddress,
      _projectId
    );
  }
```

As can be seen from the function itself which also calls _transferAmount() , nowhere is there a check for zero amount transfer.

```solidity
  function _transferAmount(address payable _recipient, uint256 _amount) private {
    if (tokenAddress == address(0)) {
      Address.sendValue(_recipient, _amount);
    } else {
      IERC20(tokenAddress).safeTransfer(_recipient, _amount);
    }
```
## Impact
This may break systems or burn tokens by transferring them to address(0).

## Recommendation
Add a simple check for zero-value token transfers.
