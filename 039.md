# Voters on a round don't know if Round Operator has put the money inside the round and can't check it

## Summary
There is no check for voters to know if round creator has put the money for the grant

## Vulnerability Detail

I know Round_Operators are trusted roles but GitCoin devs could implement variables or functions to let voters know that there is effectively the needed money for a granted project on the `RoundImplementation.sol` contract. It would massively improve the confidence users have on the platform

## Impact

As there is no requirement on the contract for the round operator to deposit money on the roundImplementation and the `_getTokenBalance(address)` is private an external voter has no insurance and will be afraid to deposit his funds to vote on the contract

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

1. Add a `require` statement for the round operator to deposit the required amount on the roundImplementation 
2. Change the `_getTokenBalance` from private visibility to external to reassure voters 
3. Implement a public variable that gets incremented at each deposit
