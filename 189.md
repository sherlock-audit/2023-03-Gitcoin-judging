# Exposed Initializer function in RoundImplementation allows for a malicious user to take control of Voting Stratgey

## Summary
Exposed Initializer function in RoundImplementation allows for a malicious user to take control of Voting Stratgey

"The IVotingStrategy (https://github.com/allo-protocol/contracts/blob/main/contracts/votingStrategy/IVotingStrategy.sol) provides a few methods and modifiers to help you implement a custom Voting Strategy.
A Round contract will call the init() method of a Voting Strategy when the Round is itself initialized. This will set the value for the roundAddress state variable, which serves two purposes: one preventing reinitialization and adding authorization to certain methods that should only be called by the Round contract.
Your implementation of the IVotingStrategy interface should implement a vote(bytes[],address) method. This is where your custom vote-counting logic should live."

## Vulnerability Detail
An attacker (Bob) can call the initialize function in RoundImplementation.

```solidity
  function initialize(
    bytes calldata encodedParameters,
    address _alloSettings
  ) external initializer {
```

Subsequently, Bob, now calling the Initializer in roundImplementation can also the init functions in IVotingStrategy.

Calling the init function in IVotingStrategy

   * @notice Invoked by RoundImplementation on creation to
   * set the round for which the voting contracts is to be used
   *
   */
```Solidity
  function init() external {
    require(roundAddress == address(0), "init: roundAddress already set");
    roundAddress = msg.sender;
  }
```

And now, the attacker has the roundAddress under control. Bob can now, as he is the roundAddress, call the below function in QuadraticFundingVotingStratgeyImplementation.

@dev
   * - more voters -> higher the gas
   * - this would be triggered when a voter casts their vote via grant explorer
   * - can be invoked by the round
   * - supports ERC20 and Native token transfer
   *
   * @param encodedVotes encoded list of votes
   * @param voterAddress voter address
   */

```solidity
  function vote(bytes[] calldata encodedVotes, address voterAddress) external override payable nonReentrant isRoundContract {

    /// @dev iterate over multiple donations and transfer funds
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < encodedVotes.length; i++) {

      /// @dev decode encoded vote
      (
        address _token,
        uint256 _amount,
        address _grantAddress,
        bytes32 _projectId
      ) = abi.decode(encodedVotes[i], (
        address,
        uint256,
        address,
        bytes32
      ));

      if (_token == address(0)) {
        /// @dev native token transfer to grant address
        // slither-disable-next-line reentrancy-events
        AddressUpgradeable.sendValue(payable(_grantAddress), _amount);
      } else {

        /// @dev erc20 transfer to grant address
        // slither-disable-next-line arbitrary-send-erc20,reentrancy-events,
        SafeERC20Upgradeable.safeTransferFrom(
          IERC20Upgradeable(_token),
          voterAddress,
          _grantAddress,
          _amount
        );
```

## Impact
This will allow Bob to manipulate votes in his favour, and manipulating the voting strategy.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
This will prevent the above scenario by securing both the Initializer function in RoundImplementation and the init function in IVotingStrategy.

```solidity
function initialize(bytes calldata encodedParameters, address _alloSettings) external Initializer onlyOwner {
```

```solidity
function init() internal {
  require(roundAddress == address(0x0), "roundAddress already set");
  roundAddress = address(this);
```
