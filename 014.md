# No Reentrancy guard on withdrawFunds function

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

There is no reentrancy guard on the withdrawFunds function. External functions with callbacks to the contract should have reentrancy guard, or check-effect-interaction module in place, in order to protect against possible exploits both from within the protocol, and outside it as well.

## Impact

## Code Snippet

    function withdrawFunds(address payable withdrawAddress) external payable virtual isRoundOperator {

    uint roundEndTime = RoundImplementation(roundAddress).roundEndTime();
    require(block.timestamp >= roundEndTime + LOCK_DURATION, "Lock duration has not ended");


    uint balance = _getTokenBalance();

    if (tokenAddress == address(0)) { 
      /// @dev native token
      AddressUpgradeable.sendValue(
        withdrawAddress,
        balance
      );
    } else { 
      /// @dev ERC20 token
      IERC20Upgradeable(tokenAddress).safeTransfer(
        withdrawAddress,
        balance
      );
    }

    emit FundsWithdrawn(tokenAddress, balance, withdrawAddress);
  }

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use nonReentrant modifier on the function to prevent reentrancy attack [ReentrancyGuard](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol)
